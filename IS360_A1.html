<p>This assignment tests your ability to&nbsp;apply the skills that you have learned to perform the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li class="ListItem">apply the Visual Studio .NET navigation skills that you learned in the hands-on labs to create Web pages and links between them.</li>
<li class="ListItem">understand the syntax of the HTML 5 language (elements, attributes, and document structure.)</li>
<li class="ListItem">use specific HTML tags and attributes to create various pages based on the labs and class presentations. (paragraphs, links, images, and selected semantic tags)</li>
<li class="ListItem">upload a Web site to a Web server in the proper folder using proper naming conventions</li>
<li class="ListItem">use the W3C validation service to verify the syntax of each page in the assignment. The validation report must be included as an image at the end of each page</li>
<li class="ListItem">test the Web site to make sure that it works. That is, you should test and make sure that the images are loading properly and that the links work. You should also verify that the URL is correct to access the web site you posted</li>
</ul>
<h2>General Requirements</h2>
<p>For this homework assignment, you will create a Web site made up of three different pages and links between those pages. You will also upload the Web site to the College of Business student Web server. The pages that you create will utilize most of the HTML 5 tags discussed so far in class. The name of the student Web server is students.coba.unr.edu. There is also an alias of swww.coba.unr.edu. So both URLs will work correctly. This is the same student Web server that you used in the labs. Your assignment MUST appear in the folder named <strong>Assignment1.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>You will create three pages named <strong>index.htm</strong>, <strong>content.htm</strong>, and <strong>copyright.htm</strong>. Make sure to name the pages correctly. On each of these pages, create a reference to the HTML 5 DTD. This is usually done automatically when you add an empty HTML 5 page in Visual Studio. Make sure that you validate the document against the HTML 5 DTD using the W3C validator mentioned in class and used in the labs. <strong>Points will be deducted for validation errors.</strong></p>
<p>Create all of the files (pages) so that they appear in the same folder on the Web server. Make sure that you remember to upload any images that are part of your site. In addition, all of the pages should have a similar look and feel. That is, the header, body, and footer content should look similar between pages. Don't worry about the formatting of text other than the formatting specified in the instructions. You will learn how to apply formatting using CSS later in the course. Do not sue CSS for this assignment.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> For each page that you create, capture a screen shot of the W3C Validation Report to show me that the page is correct. I suggest that you use the Snipping Tool to capture the screen shot. The screen shot showing that the page validated correctly should appear at the bottom of each page. <strong>Please do not take pictures from your phone!</strong> <strong>Points will be deducted if the Validation Report is not displayed for each page.</strong> <strong>Points will be deducted if the Validation Report contains errors.</strong></p>
<p>Somewhere in your pages, you must correctly use the tags we have covered in class such as &lt;code&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;, and other specifically lists in the page requirements.</p>
<h3>Index.htm</h3>
<ul>
<li class="ListItem">The Web pages in a site should have a similar look-and-feel. For this site, you should create a simple menu as follows:
<ul>
<li class="ListItem">Create a horizontal line across the very top and bottom of the page.</li>
<li class="ListItem">Also on the home (Index) page, create links to the other two pages. The links should appear just below the line at the top of the page. You must use relative links between the pages in your site. Create another horizontal line just below the menu. The menu should appear on every page and appear just like it does on the home page.</li>
<li class="ListItem">Wrap the above code (menu) in the appropriate semantic navigation tag.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="ListItem">The home page should have a level 1 heading containing your full name. Your name should appear below the links to the other two pages (navigation area).</li>
<li class="ListItem">Add a picture of your choosing to the home page such that it appears below the level 1 heading. You must use a relative reference for the image. Make sure that you have alternate text for the image for accessibility. Wrap the image in the appropriate figure and figure caption tags. Create a caption for the figure as you see fit. You can use any image you want.</li>
<li class="ListItem">Add a second picture of your choosing to this page. However, do not download this picture. Use and absolute reference to the picture on the Web. Make sure that you have alternate text for the image for accessibility. Wrap the image in the appropriate figure and figure caption tags. Create a caption for the figure as you see fit.</li>
<li class="ListItem">Put a copyright notice using the appropriate named entity at the very bottom of the page below the last horizontal line. It should have the copyright symbol, followed by your name. You can use a named or numbered entity to do this. The copyright notice should appear on all the pages and be wrapped in the appropriate semantic footer tag.</li>
<li class="ListItem">Write the necessary tag so that the text <strong>Home</strong> appears in the browser's title bar.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Content.htm</h3>
<p>For this page, you have considerable flexibility. You can use any content that you want. Pick a subject in which you are interested, and teach me something or inform me about it. You do not need to write all of the content yourself. You can cut and paste it from the Web.</p>
<p>To get full credit, your page MUST meet the following minimum requirements.</p>
<ul>
<li class="ListItem">Create a horizontal line across the very top and bottom of the page, just as you did on the first page and wrap the menu in the appropriate navigation tags.</li>
<li class="ListItem">Also on the page, create relative links to the other two pages. The links should appear just below the two horizontal lines at the top of the page.<br><br>
</li>
<li class="ListItem">Create a level 1 heading as you did on the first page. The text of the heading should describe the purpose or meaning of your site.&nbsp; Your heading should be wrapped in an &lt;article&gt; tag.<br><br>
</li>
<li class="ListItem">Your page must have at least three sections &lt;section&gt; tags and corresponding &lt;h2&gt; tags. Put your content in the sections.&nbsp;<br><br>
</li>
<li class="ListItem">Your page must have at least two images excluding the image required for the validation report. They must have semantic figure, figure caption, and alternate text.<br><br>
</li>
<li class="ListItem">Your page must have at least three links to pages that somehow relate to your page. One of those links must operate as a clickable image.<br><br>
</li>
<li class="ListItem">A billeted list must appear somewhere on the page.<br><br>
</li>
<li class="ListItem">Write the necessary tag so that the text <strong>Content</strong> appears in the browser's title bar.<br><br>
</li>
<li class="ListItem">Just below the menu and before the top &lt;h1&gt; tag, create bookmarks to the various sections. The number of bookmarks will vary based on the number of sections.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Copyright.htm</h3>
<ul>
<li class="ListItem">Again, create horizontal lines at the top and bottom of the page.</li>
<li class="ListItem">Create links to the other two pages. The links should appear just below the line at the top of the page.<br><br>
</li>
<li class="ListItem">Use the proper semantic tags to describe the reviewer or author. (that's you).</li>
<li class="ListItem">Use the proper tag to represent the article date. The date you submitted your assignment</li>
<li class="ListItem">Write the necessary tag so that the text <strong>Copyright</strong> appears in the browser's title bar.</li>
<li class="ListItem">Somewhere in the copyright notice, you must used the copyright symbol (named entity).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Posting the Web Site</h3>
<ul>
<li class="ListItem">Using FileZilla, create a folder named <strong>Assignment1</strong> on the server as a subfolder of your home folder. To do this, make sure that you are connected to the student Web Server.&nbsp; Right-click on the server folder in Filezilla (right-side). On the context menu that appears, click <strong>Create Directory</strong>. Change the name, as necessary.</li>
<li class="ListItem">Post all the files in your web site to a folder named Assignment1. That is, all files should appear as immediate children of the Assignment1 folder. Thus, the URL to your site should be http://students.coba.unr.edu/<em>yournetid</em>/Assignment1.</li>
<li class="ListItem">Make sure to test your site to make sure that everything is working correctly. I suggest that you verify that all links work, and that all images are properly rendered.</li>
<li class="ListItem">Post the URL of your Web site as your assignment submission in WebCampus.</li>
</ul>
