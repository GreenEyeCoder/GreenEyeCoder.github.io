	<br>2. Students will be able to use tools like Wireshark and ARP to examine and troubleshoot data packets.
	<br>3. Students will be able to design and manage a small local area network using appropriate configuration (physical topology, logical topology, access methods and media).
	<br>4. Students will be able to assess and monitor wireless networks, wireless access points, and network bandwidth.
	<br>5. Students will be able to develop specific and reasonable plans to secure networked communications environments by identifying assets, threats, vulnerabilities and describing appropriate network controls and protective measures.
