 <ul>
  <li>Outgoing</li>

  <p>I like to describe my self as outgoing.  As my flight going out of Reno.  The last time my trip left, I ended up in Rio de Janeiro.   There was one stop before, and that was in Panama City, Panama, for four days. Spent a week in Rio, before flying to Sao Paulo.</p>

  <li>Active</li>

  <p>Having type one diabetes since my last trip to the middle east a paid vacation in thanks to our US military being active is one of my requirements in life. I can't sit still and let this disease get the better of me, I must get out there and go jogging, and whatever gets me some fresh air.</p>

  <li>Compassionate</li>

  <p>Compassionate is a trait that stuck with me since sitting in the programmer's class back in the '80s. Remember it like yesterday, seeing the gentleman telling us that this MICROSOFT BASIC language of computers uses symbols like the dollar symbol to represent variables in your statement. I think I was about ten years of age at that time.</p>

  <li>Cheerful</li>

  <p>Currently, I am working in a toxic work environment at the United States Postal service.  The postal service is now over  140 billion in debt.  My college degree will be my exit plan from the postal service.  To break free from my golden handcuffs is my goal.  I miss most about being in a healthily work, is an environment where cheerful people exist.  I try my best to put a smile on the things that challenge me the most.</p>

  <li>Practical</li>

  <p>Being practical is how I trouble most of my issues.   Getting to a solution fast is how I make money.</p>

  </ul>
