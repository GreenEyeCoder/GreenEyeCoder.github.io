    <h1>Assignment 3</h1>
	<div class="description user_content student-version jqueryUIWidgetized enhanced"><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>For this assignment, you will use my content .&nbsp; The purpose of this assignment is not about the content, It's about using CSS to format content. You may change the template page I give you by adding &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; tags to encapsulate content. You may also add any semantic or formatting tags that you want active the required formatting. However, you should not change the structure of the HTML documents I give you.</p>
<p>In this assignment, you will demonstrate familiarity with the following skills:</p>
<ul>
<li>Referencing external and internal style sheets.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Creating simple and complex selectors involving CSS pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Apply formatting styles involving typography, borders and margins, and limited positioning.<br><br>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>General Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>You must have at least two external style sheets in a sub-folder named <strong>css</strong>. All of the pages in the assignment must use these style sheets via a relative reference. Name the first style sheet <strong>global.css</strong>.&nbsp; Create a second style sheet named <strong>colors.css</strong>, designed to apply a color scheme.&nbsp;<br><br>
</li>
<li>Your pages will use a few images. You MUST put the images in a folder named&nbsp;<strong>images&nbsp;</strong>and create relative references to them.<br><br>
</li>
<li>The&nbsp;content of each page must be exactly 1024 pixels wide and centered in the page.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Your pages should all belong to a color scheme that you create. You can use any color scheme that you want but you MUST create one. You must fully implement your chosen color scheme and it must have no less than 4 colors.&nbsp; You should create a color scheme based on either the monochromatic or analogous designs. The following link talks about color combinations: <a href="http://www.worqx.com/color/combinations.htm" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>http://www.worqx.com/color/combinations.htm</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="ui-icon ui-icon-extlink ui-icon-inline" title="Links to an external site."></span><span class="screenreader-only">&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</span></a> The styles you create should be based on these colors.&nbsp; There are several tools to help you:&nbsp;<a class="external" title="Link" href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_analogous.asp" data-preview-alt="" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>W3 Schools Color Picker.<br><br></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="ui-icon ui-icon-extlink ui-icon-inline" title="Links to an external site."></span><span class="screenreader-only">&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</span></a>
</li>
<li>You MUST use custom colors for the background and foreground - borders (figure, table, and others),&nbsp; text,<br><br>
</li>
<li>You should apply the same custom formatting to all header tags &lt;h1&gt; through &lt;h4&gt;. The first letter of the first word in the header should have a larger font size then the following text. The easiest way to do do this is to create element selectors and use percentage values to increase the relative font size.</li>
<li>The menu, header, and footer should be exactly the same for all four pages. All of the other pages should have identical formatting.<br><br>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Menu</h3>
<p>Your index page must contain a menu that links to the other pages, just as you have been doing. There must be a link to the current page and links to the other pages. The link to the current page should be shaded or appear in a slightly different color. The other links should look the same and be of the same size. The menus should occupy exactly the same position on all pages.&nbsp; All of the menus must have the same look and feel using your chosen color scheme. To get full credit, the menus must have the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>For each page, the link to the current page and the other pages should appear using your chosen color scheme.&nbsp; You should define two styles: one for the active (current) link, and one for the other thinks.&nbsp;<br><br>
</li>
<li>Implement the menu across the top of the screen.&nbsp; It should be centered. You might use a table with one row and four columns or use layouts. You might also wrap the menu in a <code>&lt;div&gt;.</code><br><br>
</li>
<li>Each menu item must have some kind of shading and rounded borders based on your chosen color scheme. You might use a radial-gradient or other gradient. You might implement box shading. You might do both.&nbsp;<br><br>
</li>
<li>Wrap the menu in a &lt;nav&gt; tag.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Header</h3>
<ul>
<li>The header should have a different background color than the main body and footer. Wrap the header in a &lt;header&gt; tag and use an element selector to format as much as you can for the header. In the header, add a "breadcrumb" to indicate where you are in the site. The breadcrumb for the home page would be <strong>Assignment3/<span style="text-decoration: underline;">netid</span>/index</strong>. where&nbsp;<strong><em>netid</em></strong> is your <strong>NetId.</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Footer</h3>
<p>All of your pages should have an identical footer. The content an images should be exactly the same and formatted the same way.</p>
<ul>
<li>The &lt;footer&gt; should have a&nbsp; different background color than the main body and header. The footer should have a 1 pixel solid border. The footer should use a font size smaller than the default .&nbsp;<br><br>
</li>
<li>Your footer text should contain your name and copyright simple as in other assignments.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Draw a vertical bar on the left side of of the footer inside of the border. Create padding or to the right of the border and to the left of the copyright text.<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li>An image should appear in the footer such that it is floated to the left of the copyright text. That is, the image should appear on the right side of the footer.. You can use the Nevada "N" if you would like:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unr.edu/marcom/university-identity/logos/downloading-logos" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>https://www.unr.edu/marcom/university-identity/logos/downloading-logos</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="ui-icon ui-icon-extlink ui-icon-inline" title="Links to an external site."></span><span class="screenreader-only">&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</span></a>. Size the logo appropriately. Given the content in the footer, make the image about 1" tall.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Index Page and Body</h3>
<p>The document body for all of the pages should have the same color scheme including foreground, and background, colors, text, and sizes. The default content I provide is for the document body. You need to write the HTML for each page's menu, header, and footer.</p>
<h3>Index Page&nbsp;</h3>
<p>There is not much on the index page other than a welcome notice on two lines.</p>
<p>You MUST format these two lines using internal styles in addition to your other styles from global.css and colors.css</p>
<p>Welcome<br>IS 360 CSS Assignment 3</p>
<ul>
<li>Center the two lines horizontally.</li>
<li>Use fonts significantly larger than an &lt;h1&gt; tag for these two lines.</li>
<li>Use all capital letters and narrower letter spacing than normal.</li>
<li>Apply a shadow of your choice to the text.<br><br>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>CSSInfo Page&nbsp;</h3>
<p>I have given you the content for this page. You just need to format it. The content template for this page appears in the following link: <span class="ally-file-link-holder link_holder"><a class="instructure_file_link" title="Assignment3ContentPage.html" href="/courses/46584/files/3799973/download?wrap=1" data-id="3799973">Assignment3ContentPage.html</a><div class="inline-block ally-enhancement ally-user-content-dropdown ally-grey-arrow-download-button">
    <a href="#" role="button" tabindex="0" class="btn btn-link al-trigger">
        <i aria-hidden="true" class="icon-mini-arrow-down"></i>
        <span class="screenreader-only">Actions</span>
    </a>
    <ul class="al-options">
        <li><a href="/courses/46584/files/3799973/download?wrap=1" data-id="3799973">Download</a></li>
        <li><a href="#" class="ally-accessible-versions" data-id="3799973">Alternative formats</a></li>
    </ul>
</div>
</span></p>
<p>For this page, you must add the menu, header, and footer. You should be able to use the same content as you used for the Index page.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br><br>You don't need to change the content. However, you can add &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; tags as needed to make your formatting work. You can also add class attributes to reference the CSS classes you to create.</p>
<ul>
<li>Apply custom foreground colors to the &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, and &lt;h3&gt; tags. Again, these should be part of your color scheme.<br><br>
</li>
<li>The content contains several &lt;strong&gt; tags.<br><br>
</li>
<li>The content contains &lt;pre&gt; tags. Format all content within a &lt;pre&gt; tag so that it has a unique foreground and background color from your color scheme. Use a mono space courier font.&nbsp;<br><br>
</li>
<li>The content contains several "notes" marked by paragraphs belonging to the class named "note". Format these notes with narrower left and right margins than the default. Again, change the background and foreground colors to identify them. Apply a vertical bar along the left margin to emphasize the note. You can do this with a one-sided border.<br><br>
</li>
<li>There are definition lists. You should format them as you see fit.<br><br>
</li>
<li>The page contains anchors. You must apply custom formatting of your choice to all anchor &lt;a&gt; tags.&nbsp;<br><br>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tabular Page (Table)</h3>
<p>I have given you the content for this page. You just need to format it. The content template for this page appears in the following link: <span class="ally-file-link-holder link_holder"><a class="instructure_file_link" title="Assignment3TablePageTemplate.html" href="/courses/46584/files/3799972/download?wrap=1" data-id="3799972">Assignment3TablePageTemplate.html</a><div class="inline-block ally-enhancement ally-user-content-dropdown ally-grey-arrow-download-button">
    <a href="#" role="button" tabindex="0" class="btn btn-link al-trigger">
        <i aria-hidden="true" class="icon-mini-arrow-down"></i>
        <span class="screenreader-only">Actions</span>
    </a>
    <ul class="al-options">
        <li><a href="/courses/46584/files/3799972/download?wrap=1" data-id="3799972">Download</a></li>
        <li><a href="#" class="ally-accessible-versions" data-id="3799972">Alternative formats</a></li>
    </ul>
</div>
</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Reference the <strong>global.css&nbsp;</strong>external style sheet mentioned above.<br><br>
</li>
<li>The table contains three columns titled Language, Value, and adoption. In the third column, you need to create a graph like the one shown. The graph bars should indicate the relative percentage as a horizontal bar. I explained how to do this in class. Create a &lt;div&gt; tag and set the width as a percentage of the parent container. Use your color scheme for the bars.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Create another style sheet named <strong>tables.css</strong>. This style sheet should contain the styles applicable to the tables.&nbsp; Add to my content the same content do declare the menu, header, and footer.&nbsp;<br><br>
</li>
<li>The page must be centered on the same 1024px wide screen you have been using. Gutters should be the same as the other pages.<br><br>
</li>
<li>h1 tags must be 1.5&nbsp;times the base chosen font. The font size of the first letter in the heading should be 1.5 times larger than the font of the rest of the header.<br><br>
</li>
<li>The default font family for the page should be Tahoma. Use the default font size. To get full credit, all font sizes should be adjusted relative to the default font size. That is, use percentages or ems. You may set borders and padding using fixed sizes.<br><br>
</li>
<li>In the external style sheet, format the table such that the header row appears emphasized. Format alternating rows in a different color. Use a pseudo-element or pseudo-class to do this. The table should be 80% of the width of the parent window (body). Again, use your chosen color scheme.<br><br>
</li>
</ul></div>
