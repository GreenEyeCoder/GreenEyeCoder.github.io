<h3>Joel 2:18-3:21</h3> <p>&nbsp;<sup>18</sup> Then the LORD will be jealous for his land <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and take pity on his people. <p>&nbsp;<sup>19</sup> The LORD will reply<sup></sup> to them: <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am sending you grain, new wine and oil, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enough to satisfy you fully; <br />never again will I make you <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an object of scorn to the nations. <p>&nbsp;<sup>20</sup> "I will drive the northern army far from you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pushing it into a parched and barren land, <br />with its front columns going into the eastern sea<sup></sup> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and those in the rear into the western sea.<sup></sup> <br />And its stench will go up; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its smell will rise." <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely he has done great things.<sup></sup> <br />&nbsp;<sup>21</sup> Be not afraid, O land; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be glad and rejoice. <br />Surely the LORD has done great things. <br />&nbsp;<sup>22</sup> Be not afraid, O wild animals, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the open pastures are becoming green. <br />The trees are bearing their fruit; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fig tree and the vine yield their riches. <br /><sup>23</sup> Be glad, O people of Zion, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rejoice in the LORD your God, <br />for he has given you <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the autumn rains in righteousness.<sup></sup> <br />He sends you abundant showers, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;both autumn and spring rains, as before. <br /><sup>24</sup> The threshing floors will be filled with grain; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the vats will overflow with new wine and oil. <p>&nbsp;<sup>25</sup> "I will repay you for the years the locusts have eaten— <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the great locust and the young locust, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the other locusts and the locust swarm<sup></sup>— <br />my great army that I sent among you. <br /><sup>26</sup> You will have plenty to eat, until you are full, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you will praise the name of the LORD your God, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who has worked wonders for you; <br />never again will my people be shamed. <br /><sup>27</sup> Then you will know that I am in Israel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I am the LORD your God, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and that there is no other; <br />never again will my people be shamed. &nbsp;<sup>28</sup> "And afterward, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will pour out my Spirit on all people. <br />Your sons and daughters will prophesy, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your old men will dream dreams, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your young men will see visions. <br /><sup>29</sup> Even on my servants, both men and women, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will pour out my Spirit in those days. <br /><sup>30</sup> I will show wonders in the heavens <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and on the earth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blood and fire and billows of smoke. <br /><sup>31</sup> The sun will be turned to darkness <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the moon to blood <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD. <br /><sup>32</sup> And everyone who calls <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the name of the LORD will be saved; <br />for on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there will be deliverance, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as the LORD has said, <br />among the survivors <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whom the LORD calls. <h4>Joel 3</h4>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> "In those days and at that time, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem, <br /><sup>2</sup> I will gather all nations <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat.<sup></sup> <br />There I will enter into judgment against them <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concerning my inheritance, my people Israel, <br />for they scattered my people among the nations <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and divided up my land. <br /><sup>3</sup> They cast lots for my people <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and traded boys for prostitutes; <br />they sold girls for wine <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that they might drink. <p>&nbsp;<sup>4</sup> "Now what have you against me, O Tyre and Sidon and all you regions of Philistia? Are you repaying me for something I have done? If you are paying me back, I will swiftly and speedily return on your own heads what you have done. <sup>5</sup> For you took my silver and my gold and carried off my finest treasures to your temples. <sup>6</sup> You sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks, that you might send them far from their homeland. <p>&nbsp;<sup>7</sup> "See, I am going to rouse them out of the places to which you sold them, and I will return on your own heads what you have done. <sup>8</sup> I will sell your sons and daughters to the people of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans, a nation far away." The LORD has spoken. <p>&nbsp;<sup>9</sup> Proclaim this among the nations: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepare for war! <br />Rouse the warriors! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let all the fighting men draw near and attack. <br /><sup>10</sup> Beat your plowshares into swords <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your pruning hooks into spears. <br />Let the weakling say, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am strong!" <br /><sup>11</sup> Come quickly, all you nations from every side, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and assemble there. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bring down your warriors, O LORD! <p>&nbsp;<sup>12</sup> "Let the nations be roused; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let them advance into the Valley of Jehoshaphat, <br />for there I will sit <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to judge all the nations on every side. <br /><sup>13</sup> Swing the sickle, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the harvest is ripe. <br />Come, trample the grapes, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the winepress is full <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the vats overflow— <br />so great is their wickedness!" <p>&nbsp;<sup>14</sup> Multitudes, multitudes <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the valley of decision! <br />For the day of the LORD is near <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the valley of decision. <br /><sup>15</sup> The sun and moon will be darkened, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the stars no longer shine. <br /><sup>16</sup> The LORD will roar from Zion <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and thunder from Jerusalem; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the earth and the sky will tremble. <br />But the LORD will be a refuge for his people, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a stronghold for the people of Israel. &nbsp;<sup>17</sup> "Then you will know that I, the LORD your God, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dwell in Zion, my holy hill. <br />Jerusalem will be holy; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;never again will foreigners invade her. <p>&nbsp;<sup>18</sup> "In that day the mountains will drip new wine, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the hills will flow with milk; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the ravines of Judah will run with water. <br />A fountain will flow out of the LORD's house <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and will water the valley of acacias.<sup></sup> <br /><sup>19</sup> But Egypt will be desolate, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edom a desert waste, <br />because of violence done to the people of Judah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in whose land they shed innocent blood. <br /><sup>20</sup> Judah will be inhabited forever <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Jerusalem through all generations. <br /><sup>21</sup> Their bloodguilt, which I have not pardoned, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will pardon." <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LORD dwells in Zion! </p> <br>

<a id= "NT"></a><h3>Hebrews 4:1-13</h3> <p><h4>Hebrews 4</h4>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> Therefore, since the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us be careful that none of you be found to have fallen short of it. <sup>2</sup> For we also have had the gospel preached to us, just as they did; but the message they heard was of no value to them, because those who heard did not combine it with faith.<sup></sup> <sup>3</sup> Now we who have believed enter that rest, just as God has said, <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I declared on oath in my anger, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"˜They shall never enter my rest.'"<sup></sup> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet his work has been finished since the creation of the world. <sup>4</sup> For somewhere he has spoken about the seventh day in these words: "And on the seventh day God rested from all his work."<sup></sup> <sup>5</sup> And again in the passage above he says, "They shall never enter my rest." <p>&nbsp;<sup>6</sup> It still remains that some will enter that rest, and those who formerly had the gospel preached to them did not go in, because of their disobedience. <sup>7</sup> Therefore God again set a certain day, calling it Today, when a long time later he spoke through David, as was said before: <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today, if you hear his voice, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do not harden your hearts."<sup></sup> <p>&nbsp;<sup>8</sup> For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later about another day. <sup>9</sup> There remains, then, a Sabbath-rest for the people of God; <sup>10</sup> for anyone who enters God's rest also rests from his own work, just as God did from his. <sup>11</sup> Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will fall by following their example of disobedience. <p>&nbsp;<sup>12</sup> For the word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart. <sup>13</sup> Nothing in all creation is hidden from God's sight. Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account. </p> <br><h3>Psalm 119:145-152</h3> <p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<sup>145</sup> I call with all my heart; answer me, O LORD, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I will obey your decrees. <br /><sup>146</sup> I call out to you; save me <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I will keep your statutes. <br /><sup>147</sup> I rise before dawn and cry for help; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have put my hope in your word. <br /><sup>148</sup> My eyes stay open through the watches of the night, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I may meditate on your promises. <br /><sup>149</sup> Hear my voice in accordance with your love; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preserve my life, O LORD, according to your laws. <br /><sup>150</sup> Those who devise wicked schemes are near, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they are far from your law. <br /><sup>151</sup> Yet you are near, O LORD, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all your commands are true. <br /><sup>152</sup> Long ago I learned from your statutes <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that you established them to last forever. </p><br></div><!--closing tags for 2ndcolumn-->
