        <h3>Jeremiah 40:7-42:22</h3><div> <p>&nbsp;<sup>7</sup> When all the army officers and their men who were still in the open country heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam as governor over the land and had put him in charge of the men, women and children who were the poorest in the land and who had not been carried into exile to Babylon, <sup>8</sup> they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah<sup></sup> the son of the Maacathite, and their men. <sup>9</sup> Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, took an oath to reassure them and their men. "Do not be afraid to serve the Babylonians," he said. "Settle down in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well with you. <sup>10</sup> I myself will stay at Mizpah to represent you before the Babylonians who come to us, but you are to harvest the wine, summer fruit and oil, and put them in your storage jars, and live in the towns you have taken over." </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>11</sup> When all the Jews in Moab, Ammon, Edom and all the other countries heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah and had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, as governor over them, <sup>12</sup> they all came back to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, from all the countries where they had been scattered. And they harvested an abundance of wine and summer fruit. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>13</sup> Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers still in the open country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah <sup>14</sup> and said to him, "Don't you know that Baalis king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah to take your life?" But Gedaliah son of Ahikam did not believe them. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>15</sup> Then Johanan son of Kareah said privately to Gedaliah in Mizpah, "Let me go and kill Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and no one will know it. Why should he take your life and cause all the Jews who are gathered around you to be scattered and the remnant of Judah to perish?" </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>16</sup> But Gedaliah son of Ahikam said to Johanan son of Kareah, "Don't do such a thing! What you are saying about Ishmael is not true." </p><h4>Jeremiah 41</h4><p>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> In the seventh month Ishmael son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, who was of royal blood and had been one of the king's officers, came with ten men to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah. While they were eating together there, <sup>2</sup> Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the ten men who were with him got up and struck down Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, with the sword, killing the one whom the king of Babylon had appointed as governor over the land. <sup>3</sup> Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, as well as the Babylonian soldiers who were there. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>4</sup> The day after Gedaliah's assassination, before anyone knew about it, <sup>5</sup> eighty men who had shaved off their beards, torn their clothes and cut themselves came from Shechem, Shiloh and Samaria, bringing grain offerings and incense with them to the house of the LORD. <sup>6</sup> Ishmael son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he went. When he met them, he said, "Come to Gedaliah son of Ahikam." <sup>7</sup> When they went into the city, Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the men who were with him slaughtered them and threw them into a cistern. <sup>8</sup> But ten of them said to Ishmael, "Don't kill us! We have wheat and barley, oil and honey, hidden in a field." So he let them alone and did not kill them with the others. <sup>9</sup> Now the cistern where he threw all the bodies of the men he had killed along with Gedaliah was the one King Asa had made as part of his defense against Baasha king of Israel. Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled it with the dead. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>10</sup> Ishmael made captives of all the rest of the people who were in Mizpahthe king's daughters along with all the others who were left there, over whom Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam. Ishmael son of Nethaniah took them captive and set out to cross over to the Ammonites. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>11</sup> When Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him heard about all the crimes Ishmael son of Nethaniah had committed, <sup>12</sup> they took all their men and went to fight Ishmael son of Nethaniah. They caught up with him near the great pool in Gibeon. <sup>13</sup> When all the people Ishmael had with him saw Johanan son of Kareah and the army officers who were with him, they were glad. <sup>14</sup> All the people Ishmael had taken captive at Mizpah turned and went over to Johanan son of Kareah. <sup>15</sup> But Ishmael son of Nethaniah and eight of his men escaped from Johanan and fled to the Ammonites. &nbsp;<sup>16</sup> Then Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him led away all the survivors from Mizpah whom he had recovered from Ishmael son of Nethaniah after he had assassinated Gedaliah son of Ahikam: the soldiers, women, children and court officials he had brought from Gibeon. <sup>17</sup> And they went on, stopping at Geruth Kimham near Bethlehem on their way to Egypt <sup>18</sup> to escape the Babylonians. They were afraid of them because Ishmael son of Nethaniah had killed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had appointed as governor over the land. </p><h4>Jeremiah 42</h4><p>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> Then all the army officers, including Johanan son of Kareah and Jezaniah son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least to the greatest approached <sup>2</sup> Jeremiah the prophet and said to him, "Please hear our petition and pray to the LORD your God for this entire remnant. For as you now see, though we were once many, now only a few are left. <sup>3</sup> Pray that the LORD your God will tell us where we should go and what we should do." </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>4</sup> "I have heard you," replied Jeremiah the prophet. "I will certainly pray to the LORD your God as you have requested; I will tell you everything the LORD says and will keep nothing back from you." </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>5</sup> Then they said to Jeremiah, "May the LORD be a true and faithful witness against us if we do not act in accordance with everything the LORD your God sends you to tell us. <sup>6</sup> Whether it is favorable or unfavorable, we will obey the LORD our God, to whom we are sending you, so that it will go well with us, for we will obey the LORD our God." </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>7</sup> Ten days later the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah. <sup>8</sup> So he called together Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him and all the people from the least to the greatest. <sup>9</sup> He said to them, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your petition, says: <sup>10</sup> "˜If you stay in this land, I will build you up and not tear you down; I will plant you and not uproot you, for I am grieved over the disaster I have inflicted on you. <sup>11</sup> Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, whom you now fear. Do not be afraid of him, declares the LORD, for I am with you and will save you and deliver you from his hands. <sup>12</sup> I will show you compassion so that he will have compassion on you and restore you to your land.' </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>13</sup> "However, if you say, "˜We will not stay in this land,' and so disobey the LORD your God, <sup>14</sup> and if you say, "˜No, we will go and live in Egypt, where we will not see war or hear the trumpet or be hungry for bread,' <sup>15</sup> then hear the word of the LORD, O remnant of Judah. This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: "˜If you are determined to go to Egypt and you do go to settle there, <sup>16</sup> then the sword you fear will overtake you there, and the famine you dread will follow you into Egypt, and there you will die. <sup>17</sup> Indeed, all who are determined to go to Egypt to settle there will die by the sword, famine and plague; not one of them will survive or escape the disaster I will bring on them.' <sup>18</sup> This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: "˜As my anger and wrath have been poured out on those who lived in Jerusalem, so will my wrath be poured out on you when you go to Egypt. You will be an object of cursing and horror, of condemnation and reproach; you will never see this place again.' </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>19</sup> "O remnant of Judah, the LORD has told you, "˜Do not go to Egypt.' Be sure of this: I warn you today <sup>20</sup> that you made a fatal mistake when you sent me to the LORD your God and said, "˜Pray to the LORD our God for us; tell us everything he says and we will do it.' <sup>21</sup> I have told you today, but you still have not obeyed the LORD your God in all he sent me to tell you. <sup>22</sup> So now, be sure of this: You will die by the sword, famine and plague in the place where you want to go to settle." </p> </div>

        <h3>1 Timothy 4:1-16</h3><div> <p></p><h4>1 Timothy 4</h4>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons. <sup>2</sup> Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron. <sup>3</sup> They forbid people to marry and order them to abstain from certain foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and who know the truth. <sup>4</sup> For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving, <sup>5</sup> because it is consecrated by the word of God and prayer. <p>&nbsp;<sup>6</sup> If you point these things out to the brothers, you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus, brought up in the truths of the faith and of the good teaching that you have followed. <sup>7</sup> Have nothing to do with godless myths and old wives' tales; rather, train yourself to be godly. <sup>8</sup> For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>9</sup> This is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance <sup>10</sup> (and for this we labor and strive), that we have put our hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, and especially of those who believe. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>11</sup> Command and teach these things. <sup>12</sup> Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in life, in love, in faith and in purity. <sup>13</sup> Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to preaching and to teaching. <sup>14</sup> Do not neglect your gift, which was given you through a prophetic message when the body of elders laid their hands on you. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>15</sup> Be diligent in these matters; give yourself wholly to them, so that everyone may see your progress. <sup>16</sup> Watch your life and doctrine closely. Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers. </p></div><br><h3>Proverbs 25:11-20</h3><div> <p></p><p>&nbsp;<sup>11</sup> A word aptly spoken <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is like apples of gold in settings of silver. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>12</sup> Like an earring of gold or an ornament of fine gold <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a wise man's rebuke to a listening ear. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>13</sup> Like the coolness of snow at harvest time <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a trustworthy messenger to those who send him; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he refreshes the spirit of his masters. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>14</sup> Like clouds and wind without rain <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a man who boasts of gifts he does not give. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>15</sup> Through patience a ruler can be persuaded, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a gentle tongue can break a bone. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>16</sup> If you find honey, eat just enough <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;too much of it, and you will vomit. <br><sup>17</sup> Seldom set foot in your neighbor's house<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;too much of you, and he will hate you. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>18</sup> Like a club or a sword or a sharp arrow <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the man who gives false testimony against his neighbor. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>19</sup> Like a bad tooth or a lame foot <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is reliance on the unfaithful in times of trouble. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>20</sup> Like one who takes away a garment on a cold day, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or like vinegar poured on soda, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is one who sings songs to a heavy heart. </p></div><br></div>
