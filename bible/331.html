<h3>Daniel 2:24-3:12</h3> <p>&nbsp;<sup>24</sup> Then Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to execute the wise men of Babylon, and said to him, "Do not execute the wise men of Babylon. Take me to the king, and I will interpret his dream for him." <p>&nbsp;<sup>25</sup> Arioch took Daniel to the king at once and said, "I have found a man among the exiles from Judah who can tell the king what his dream means." <p>&nbsp;<sup>26</sup> The king asked Daniel (also called Belteshazzar), "Are you able to tell me what I saw in my dream and interpret it?" <p>&nbsp;<sup>27</sup> Daniel replied, "No wise man, enchanter, magician or diviner can explain to the king the mystery he has asked about, <sup>28</sup> but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries. He has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in days to come. Your dream and the visions that passed through your mind as you lay on your bed are these: <p>&nbsp;<sup>29</sup> "As you were lying there, O king, your mind turned to things to come, and the revealer of mysteries showed you what is going to happen. <sup>30</sup> As for me, this mystery has been revealed to me, not because I have greater wisdom than other living men, but so that you, O king, may know the interpretation and that you may understand what went through your mind. <p>&nbsp;<sup>31</sup> "You looked, O king, and there before you stood a large statue—an enormous, dazzling statue, awesome in appearance. <sup>32</sup> The head of the statue was made of pure gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze, <sup>33</sup> its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay. <sup>34</sup> While you were watching, a rock was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them. <sup>35</sup> Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were broken to pieces at the same time and became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summer. The wind swept them away without leaving a trace. But the rock that struck the statue became a huge mountain and filled the whole earth. <p>&nbsp;<sup>36</sup> "This was the dream, and now we will interpret it to the king. <sup>37</sup> You, O king, are the king of kings. The God of heaven has given you dominion and power and might and glory; <sup>38</sup> in your hands he has placed mankind and the beasts of the field and the birds of the air. Wherever they live, he has made you ruler over them all. You are that head of gold. <p>&nbsp;<sup>39</sup> "After you, another kingdom will rise, inferior to yours. Next, a third kingdom, one of bronze, will rule over the whole earth. <sup>40</sup> Finally, there will be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron—for iron breaks and smashes everything—and as iron breaks things to pieces, so it will crush and break all the others. <sup>41</sup> Just as you saw that the feet and toes were partly of baked clay and partly of iron, so this will be a divided kingdom; yet it will have some of the strength of iron in it, even as you saw iron mixed with clay. <sup>42</sup> As the toes were partly iron and partly clay, so this kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle. <sup>43</sup> And just as you saw the iron mixed with baked clay, so the people will be a mixture and will not remain united, any more than iron mixes with clay. <p>&nbsp;<sup>44</sup> "In the time of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor will it be left to another people. It will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it will itself endure forever. <sup>45</sup> This is the meaning of the vision of the rock cut out of a mountain, but not by human hands—a rock that broke the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver and the gold to pieces. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The great God has shown the king what will take place in the future. The dream is true and the interpretation is trustworthy." <p>&nbsp;<sup>46</sup> Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell prostrate before Daniel and paid him honor and ordered that an offering and incense be presented to him. <sup>47</sup> The king said to Daniel, "Surely your God is the God of gods and the Lord of kings and a revealer of mysteries, for you were able to reveal this mystery." <p>&nbsp;<sup>48</sup> Then the king placed Daniel in a high position and lavished many gifts on him. He made him ruler over the entire province of Babylon and placed him in charge of all its wise men. <sup>49</sup> Moreover, at Daniel's request the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego administrators over the province of Babylon, while Daniel himself remained at the royal court. <h4>Daniel 3</h4>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> King Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold, ninety feet high and nine feet<sup></sup> wide, and set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon. <sup>2</sup> He then summoned the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates and all the other provincial officials to come to the dedication of the image he had set up. <sup>3</sup> So the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates and all the other provincial officials assembled for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up, and they stood before it. <p>&nbsp;<sup>4</sup> Then the herald loudly proclaimed, "This is what you are commanded to do, O peoples, nations and men of every language: <sup>5</sup> As soon as you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes and all kinds of music, you must fall down and worship the image of gold that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up. <sup>6</sup> Whoever does not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into a blazing furnace." <p>&nbsp;<sup>7</sup> Therefore, as soon as they heard the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp and all kinds of music, all the peoples, nations and men of every language fell down and worshiped the image of gold that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. <p>&nbsp;<sup>8</sup> At this time some astrologers<sup></sup> came forward and denounced the Jews. <sup>9</sup> They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, "O king, live forever! <sup>10</sup> You have issued a decree, O king, that everyone who hears the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes and all kinds of music must fall down and worship the image of gold, <sup>11</sup> and that whoever does not fall down and worship will be thrown into a blazing furnace. <sup>12</sup> But there are some Jews whom you have set over the affairs of the province of Babylon—Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego—who pay no attention to you, O king. They neither serve your gods nor worship the image of gold you have set up." </p> <br>

<a id= "NT"></a><h3>2 Peter 1:1-21</h3> <p><h4>2 Peter 1</h4><p>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those who through the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ have received a faith as precious as ours: <p>&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> Grace and peace be yours in abundance through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord. &nbsp;<sup>3</sup> His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness. <sup>4</sup> Through these he has given us his very great and precious promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature and escape the corruption in the world caused by evil desires. <p>&nbsp;<sup>5</sup> For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge; <sup>6</sup> and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness; <sup>7</sup> and to godliness, brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness, love. <sup>8</sup> For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. <sup>9</sup> But if anyone does not have them, he is nearsighted and blind, and has forgotten that he has been cleansed from his past sins. <p>&nbsp;<sup>10</sup> Therefore, my brothers, be all the more eager to make your calling and election sure. For if you do these things, you will never fall, <sup>11</sup> and you will receive a rich welcome into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. &nbsp;<sup>12</sup> So I will always remind you of these things, even though you know them and are firmly established in the truth you now have. <sup>13</sup> I think it is right to refresh your memory as long as I live in the tent of this body, <sup>14</sup> because I know that I will soon put it aside, as our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me. <sup>15</sup> And I will make every effort to see that after my departure you will always be able to remember these things. <p>&nbsp;<sup>16</sup> We did not follow cleverly invented stories when we told you about the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. <sup>17</sup> For he received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice came to him from the Majestic Glory, saying, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."<sup></sup> <sup>18</sup> We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we were with him on the sacred mountain. <p>&nbsp;<sup>19</sup> And we have the word of the prophets made more certain, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts. <sup>20</sup> Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet's own interpretation. <sup>21</sup> For prophecy never had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit. </p> <br><h3>Psalm 135:1-12</h3> <p><h4>Psalm 135</h4>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> Praise the LORD.<sup></sup> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Praise the name of the LORD; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;praise him, you servants of the LORD, <br /><sup>2</sup> you who minister in the house of the LORD, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the courts of the house of our God. <p>&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> Praise the LORD, for the LORD is good; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sing praise to his name, for that is pleasant. <br /><sup>4</sup> For the LORD has chosen Jacob to be his own, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel to be his treasured possession. <p>&nbsp;<sup>5</sup> I know that the LORD is great, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that our Lord is greater than all gods. <br /><sup>6</sup> The LORD does whatever pleases him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the heavens and on the earth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the seas and all their depths. <br /><sup>7</sup> He makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he sends lightning with the rain <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and brings out the wind from his storehouses. <p>&nbsp;<sup>8</sup> He struck down the firstborn of Egypt, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the firstborn of men and animals. <br /><sup>9</sup> He sent his signs and wonders into your midst, O Egypt, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against Pharaoh and all his servants. <br /><sup>10</sup> He struck down many nations <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and killed mighty kings— <br /><sup>11</sup> Sihon king of the Amorites, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Og king of Bashan <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all the kings of Canaan— <br /><sup>12</sup> and he gave their land as an inheritance, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an inheritance to his people Israel. </p> <br></div><!--closing tags for 2ndcolumn-->
