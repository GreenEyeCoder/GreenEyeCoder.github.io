        <h3>Habakkuk 1-3:19</h3> <p></p><h4>Habakkuk 1</h4><p>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> The oracle that Habakkuk the prophet received. &nbsp;<sup>2</sup> How long, O LORD, must I call for help, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but you do not listen? <br>Or cry out to you, "Violence!" <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but you do not save? <br><sup>3</sup> Why do you make me look at injustice? <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you tolerate wrong? <br>Destruction and violence are before me; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is strife, and conflict abounds. <br><sup>4</sup> Therefore the law is paralyzed, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and justice never prevails. <br>The wicked hem in the righteous, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that justice is perverted. &nbsp;<sup>5</sup> "Look at the nations and watch— <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and be utterly amazed. <br>For I am going to do something in your days <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that you would not believe, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even if you were told. <br><sup>6</sup> I am raising up the Babylonians,<sup></sup> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that ruthless and impetuous people, <br>who sweep across the whole earth <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to seize dwelling places not their own. <br><sup>7</sup> They are a feared and dreaded people; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are a law to themselves <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and promote their own honor. <br><sup>8</sup> Their horses are swifter than leopards, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fiercer than wolves at dusk. <br>Their cavalry gallops headlong; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their horsemen come from afar. <br>They fly like a vulture swooping to devour; <br>&nbsp;<sup>9</sup> they all come bent on violence. <br>Their hordes<sup></sup> advance like a desert wind <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and gather prisoners like sand. <br><sup>10</sup> They deride kings <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and scoff at rulers. <br>They laugh at all fortified cities; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they build earthen ramps and capture them. <br><sup>11</sup> Then they sweep past like the wind and go on— <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;guilty men, whose own strength is their god." &nbsp;<sup>12</sup> O LORD, are you not from everlasting? <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My God, my Holy One, we will not die. <br>O LORD, you have appointed them to execute judgment; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Rock, you have ordained them to punish. <br><sup>13</sup> Your eyes are too pure to look on evil; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you cannot tolerate wrong. <br>Why then do you tolerate the treacherous? <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are you silent while the wicked <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;swallow up those more righteous than themselves? <br><sup>14</sup> You have made men like fish in the sea, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like sea creatures that have no ruler. <br><sup>15</sup> The wicked foe pulls all of them up with hooks, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he catches them in his net, <br>he gathers them up in his dragnet; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and so he rejoices and is glad. <br><sup>16</sup> Therefore he sacrifices to his net <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and burns incense to his dragnet, <br>for by his net he lives in luxury <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and enjoys the choicest food. <br><sup>17</sup> Is he to keep on emptying his net, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;destroying nations without mercy? </p><h4>Habakkuk 2</h4><p>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> I will stand at my watch <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and station myself on the ramparts; <br>I will look to see what he will say to me, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and what answer I am to give to this complaint.<sup></sup> &nbsp;<sup>2</sup> Then the LORD replied: </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Write down the revelation <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and make it plain on tablets <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that a herald<sup></sup> may run with it. <br><sup>3</sup> For the revelation awaits an appointed time; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it speaks of the end <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and will not prove false. <br>Though it linger, wait for it; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it<sup></sup> will certainly come and will not delay. <br><sup>4</sup> "See, he is puffed up; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his desires are not upright— <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the righteous will live by his faith<sup></sup>— <br><sup>5</sup> indeed, wine betrays him; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he is arrogant and never at rest. <br>Because he is as greedy as the grave<sup></sup> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and like death is never satisfied, <br>he gathers to himself all the nations <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and takes captive all the peoples. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>6</sup> "Will not all of them taunt him with ridicule and scorn, saying, </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""˜Woe to him who piles up stolen goods <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and makes himself wealthy by extortion! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long must this go on?' <br><sup>7</sup> Will not your debtors<sup></sup> suddenly arise? <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will they not wake up and make you tremble? <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you will become their victim. <br><sup>8</sup> Because you have plundered many nations, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the peoples who are left will plunder you. <br>For you have shed man's blood; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you have destroyed lands and cities and everyone in them. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>9</sup> "Woe to him who builds his realm by unjust gain <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to set his nest on high, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to escape the clutches of ruin! <br><sup>10</sup> You have plotted the ruin of many peoples, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shaming your own house and forfeiting your life. <br><sup>11</sup> The stones of the wall will cry out, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the beams of the woodwork will echo it. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>12</sup> "Woe to him who builds a city with bloodshed <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and establishes a town by crime! <br><sup>13</sup> Has not the LORD Almighty determined <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the people's labor is only fuel for the fire, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the nations exhaust themselves for nothing? <br><sup>14</sup> For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as the waters cover the sea. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>15</sup> "Woe to him who gives drink to his neighbors, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pouring it from the wineskin till they are drunk, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that he can gaze on their naked bodies. <br><sup>16</sup> You will be filled with shame instead of glory. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it is your turn! Drink and be exposed<sup></sup>! <br>The cup from the LORD's right hand is coming around to you, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and disgrace will cover your glory. <br><sup>17</sup> The violence you have done to Lebanon will overwhelm you, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your destruction of animals will terrify you. <br>For you have shed man's blood; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you have destroyed lands and cities and everyone in them. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>18</sup> "Of what value is an idol, since a man has carved it? <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or an image that teaches lies? <br>For he who makes it trusts in his own creation; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he makes idols that cannot speak. <br><sup>19</sup> Woe to him who says to wood, "˜Come to life!' <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or to lifeless stone, "˜Wake up!' <br>Can it give guidance? <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is covered with gold and silver; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is no breath in it. <br><sup>20</sup> But the LORD is in his holy temple; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let all the earth be silent before him." </p><h4>Habakkuk 3</h4>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet. On <i>shigionoth</i>.<sup></sup> <p>&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> LORD, I have heard of your fame; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stand in awe of your deeds, O LORD. <br>Renew them in our day, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in our time make them known; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in wrath remember mercy. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> God came from Teman, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Holy One from Mount Paran. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Selah</i><br><sup></sup> <br>His glory covered the heavens <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his praise filled the earth. <br><sup>4</sup> His splendor was like the sunrise; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rays flashed from his hand, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where his power was hidden. <br><sup>5</sup> Plague went before him; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pestilence followed his steps. <br><sup>6</sup> He stood, and shook the earth; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he looked, and made the nations tremble. <br>The ancient mountains crumbled <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the age-old hills collapsed. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His ways are eternal. <br><sup>7</sup> I saw the tents of Cushan in distress, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the dwellings of Midian in anguish. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>8</sup> Were you angry with the rivers, O LORD? <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was your wrath against the streams? <br>Did you rage against the sea <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when you rode with your horses <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your victorious chariots? <br><sup>9</sup> You uncovered your bow, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you called for many arrows. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Selah</i><br> <br>You split the earth with rivers; <br>&nbsp;<sup>10</sup> the mountains saw you and writhed. <br>Torrents of water swept by; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the deep roared <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and lifted its waves on high. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>11</sup> Sun and moon stood still in the heavens <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the glint of your flying arrows, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the lightning of your flashing spear. <br><sup>12</sup> In wrath you strode through the earth <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and in anger you threshed the nations. <br><sup>13</sup> You came out to deliver your people, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to save your anointed one. <br>You crushed the leader of the land of wickedness, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you stripped him from head to foot. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Selah</i><br> <br><sup>14</sup> With his own spear you pierced his head <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when his warriors stormed out to scatter us, <br>gloating as though about to devour <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the wretched who were in hiding. <br><sup>15</sup> You trampled the sea with your horses, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;churning the great waters. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>16</sup> I heard and my heart pounded, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my lips quivered at the sound; <br>decay crept into my bones, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my legs trembled. <br>Yet I will wait patiently for the day of calamity <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to come on the nation invading us. <br><sup>17</sup> Though the fig tree does not bud <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and there are no grapes on the vines, <br>though the olive crop fails <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the fields produce no food, <br>though there are no sheep in the pen <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and no cattle in the stalls, <br><sup>18</sup> yet I will rejoice in the LORD, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be joyful in God my Savior. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>19</sup> The Sovereign LORD is my strength; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he makes my feet like the feet of a deer, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he enables me to go on the heights. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the director of music. On my stringed instruments. </p> <br>

        <h3>Titus 2:1-15</h3> <p></p><h4>Titus 2</h4>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> You must teach what is in accord with sound doctrine. <sup>2</sup> Teach the older men to be temperate, worthy of respect, self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance. <p>&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> Likewise, teach the older women to be reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but to teach what is good. <sup>4</sup> Then they can train the younger women to love their husbands and children, <sup>5</sup> to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home, to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word of God. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>6</sup> Similarly, encourage the young men to be self-controlled. <sup>7</sup> In everything set them an example by doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness <sup>8</sup> and soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>9</sup> Teach slaves to be subject to their masters in everything, to try to please them, not to talk back to them, <sup>10</sup> and not to steal from them, but to show that they can be fully trusted, so that in every way they will make the teaching about God our Savior attractive. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>11</sup> For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men. <sup>12</sup> It teaches us to say "No" to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age, <sup>13</sup> while we wait for the blessed hope—the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, <sup>14</sup> who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own, eager to do what is good. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>15</sup> These, then, are the things you should teach. Encourage and rebuke with all authority. Do not let anyone despise you. </p><br><h3>Proverbs 26:3-12</h3> <p></p><p>&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> A whip for the horse, a halter for the donkey, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a rod for the backs of fools! </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>4</sup> Do not answer a fool according to his folly, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or you will be like him yourself. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>5</sup> Answer a fool according to his folly, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or he will be wise in his own eyes. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>6</sup> Like cutting off one's feet or drinking violence <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the sending of a message by the hand of a fool. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>7</sup> Like a lame man's legs that hang limp <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a proverb in the mouth of a fool. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>8</sup> Like tying a stone in a sling <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the giving of honor to a fool. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>9</sup> Like a thornbush in a drunkard's hand <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a proverb in the mouth of a fool. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>10</sup> Like an archer who wounds at random <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is he who hires a fool or any passer-by. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>11</sup> As a dog returns to its vomit, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so a fool repeats his folly. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>12</sup> Do you see a man wise in his own eyes? <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is more hope for a fool than for him. </p><br>
