        <h3>Jeremiah 49:7-50:10</h3> <p>&nbsp;<sup>7</sup> Concerning Edom: </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what the LORD Almighty says: </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there no longer wisdom in Teman? <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has counsel perished from the prudent? <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has their wisdom decayed? <br><sup>8</sup> Turn and flee, hide in deep caves, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you who live in Dedan, <br>for I will bring disaster on Esau <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the time I punish him. <br><sup>9</sup> If grape pickers came to you, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would they not leave a few grapes? <br>If thieves came during the night, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would they not steal only as much as they wanted? <br><sup>10</sup> But I will strip Esau bare; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will uncover his hiding places, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that he cannot conceal himself. <br>His children, relatives and neighbors will perish, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he will be no more. <br><sup>11</sup> Leave your orphans; I will protect their lives. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your widows too can trust in me." </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>12</sup> This is what the LORD says: "If those who do not deserve to drink the cup must drink it, why should you go unpunished? You will not go unpunished, but must drink it. <sup>13</sup> I swear by myself," declares the LORD, "that Bozrah will become a ruin and an object of horror, of reproach and of cursing; and all its towns will be in ruins forever." </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>14</sup> I have heard a message from the LORD: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An envoy was sent to the nations to say, <br>"Assemble yourselves to attack it! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rise up for battle!" </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>15</sup> "Now I will make you small among the nations, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;despised among men. <br><sup>16</sup> The terror you inspire <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the pride of your heart have deceived you, <br>you who live in the clefts of the rocks, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who occupy the heights of the hill. <br>Though you build your nest as high as the eagle's, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from there I will bring you down," <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD. <br><sup>17</sup> "Edom will become an object of horror; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all who pass by will be appalled and will scoff <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of all its wounds. <br><sup>18</sup> As Sodom and Gomorrah were overthrown, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;along with their neighboring towns," <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;says the LORD, <br>"so no one will live there; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no man will dwell in it. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>19</sup> "Like a lion coming up from Jordan's thickets <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to a rich pastureland, <br>I will chase Edom from its land in an instant. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is the chosen one I will appoint for this? <br>Who is like me and who can challenge me? <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what shepherd can stand against me?" <br><sup>20</sup> Therefore, hear what the LORD has planned against Edom, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what he has purposed against those who live in Teman: <br>The young of the flock will be dragged away; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will completely destroy their pasture because of them. <br><sup>21</sup> At the sound of their fall the earth will tremble; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their cry will resound to the Red Sea.<sup></sup> <br><sup>22</sup> Look! An eagle will soar and swoop down, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spreading its wings over Bozrah. <br>In that day the hearts of Edom's warriors <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will be like the heart of a woman in labor. &nbsp;<sup>23</sup> Concerning Damascus: </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hamath and Arpad are dismayed, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for they have heard bad news. <br>They are disheartened, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;troubled like<sup></sup> the restless sea. <br><sup>24</sup> Damascus has become feeble, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she has turned to flee <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and panic has gripped her; <br>anguish and pain have seized her, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pain like that of a woman in labor. <br><sup>25</sup> Why has the city of renown not been abandoned, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the town in which I delight? <br><sup>26</sup> Surely, her young men will fall in the streets; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all her soldiers will be silenced in that day," <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD Almighty. <br><sup>27</sup> "I will set fire to the walls of Damascus; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it will consume the fortresses of Ben-Hadad." &nbsp;<sup>28</sup> Concerning Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon attacked: </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what the LORD says: </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Arise, and attack Kedar <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and destroy the people of the East. <br><sup>29</sup> Their tents and their flocks will be taken; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their shelters will be carried off <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with all their goods and camels. <br>Men will shout to them, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"˜Terror on every side!' </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>30</sup> "Flee quickly away! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stay in deep caves, you who live in Hazor," <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD. <br>"Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has plotted against you; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he has devised a plan against you. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>31</sup> "Arise and attack a nation at ease, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which lives in confidence," <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD, <br>"a nation that has neither gates nor bars; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its people live alone. <br><sup>32</sup> Their camels will become plunder, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their large herds will be booty. <br>I will scatter to the winds those who are in distant places<sup></sup> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and will bring disaster on them from every side," <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD. <br><sup>33</sup> "Hazor will become a haunt of jackals, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a desolate place forever. <br>No one will live there; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no man will dwell in it." &nbsp;<sup>34</sup> This is the word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam, early in the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah: </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>35</sup> This is what the LORD Almighty says: </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"See, I will break the bow of Elam, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the mainstay of their might. <br><sup>36</sup> I will bring against Elam the four winds <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the four quarters of the heavens; <br>I will scatter them to the four winds, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and there will not be a nation <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where Elam's exiles do not go. <br><sup>37</sup> I will shatter Elam before their foes, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before those who seek their lives; <br>I will bring disaster upon them, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even my fierce anger," <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD. <br>"I will pursue them with the sword <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until I have made an end of them. <br><sup>38</sup> I will set my throne in Elam <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and destroy her king and officials," <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>39</sup> "Yet I will restore the fortunes of Elam <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in days to come," <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD. </p><h4>Jeremiah 50</h4>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> This is the word the LORD spoke through Jeremiah the prophet concerning Babylon and the land of the Babylonians<sup></sup>: <p>&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> "Announce and proclaim among the nations, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lift up a banner and proclaim it; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keep nothing back, but say, <br>"˜Babylon will be captured; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bel will be put to shame, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marduk filled with terror. <br>Her images will be put to shame <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and her idols filled with terror.' <br><sup>3</sup> A nation from the north will attack her <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and lay waste her land. <br>No one will live in it; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;both men and animals will flee away. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>4</sup> "In those days, at that time," <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD, <br>"the people of Israel and the people of Judah together <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will go in tears to seek the LORD their God. <br><sup>5</sup> They will ask the way to Zion <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and turn their faces toward it. <br>They will come and bind themselves to the LORD <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in an everlasting covenant <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that will not be forgotten. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>6</sup> "My people have been lost sheep; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their shepherds have led them astray <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and caused them to roam on the mountains. <br>They wandered over mountain and hill <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and forgot their own resting place. <br><sup>7</sup> Whoever found them devoured them; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their enemies said, "˜We are not guilty, <br>for they sinned against the LORD, their true pasture, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD, the hope of their fathers.' </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>8</sup> "Flee out of Babylon; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leave the land of the Babylonians, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and be like the goats that lead the flock. <br><sup>9</sup> For I will stir up and bring against Babylon <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an alliance of great nations from the land of the north. <br>They will take up their positions against her, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and from the north she will be captured. <br>Their arrows will be like skilled warriors <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who do not return empty-handed. <br><sup>10</sup> So Babylonia<sup></sup> will be plundered; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all who plunder her will have their fill," <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD. </p><br>

        <h3>2 Timothy 2:1-26</h3> <p></p><h4>2 Timothy 2</h4><p>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> You then, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. <sup>2</sup> And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable men who will also be qualified to teach others. <sup>3</sup> Endure hardship with us like a good soldier of Christ Jesus. <sup>4</sup> No one serving as a soldier gets involved in civilian affairs—he wants to please his commanding officer. <sup>5</sup> Similarly, if anyone competes as an athlete, he does not receive the victor's crown unless he competes according to the rules. <sup>6</sup> The hardworking farmer should be the first to receive a share of the crops. <sup>7</sup> Reflect on what I am saying, for the Lord will give you insight into all this. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>8</sup> Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, descended from David. This is my gospel, <sup>9</sup> for which I am suffering even to the point of being chained like a criminal. But God's word is not chained. <sup>10</sup> Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>11</sup> Here is a trustworthy saying: </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we died with him, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we will also live with him; <br><sup>12</sup> if we endure, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we will also reign with him. <br>If we disown him, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will also disown us; <br><sup>13</sup> if we are faithless, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will remain faithful, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for he cannot disown himself. &nbsp;<sup>14</sup> Keep reminding them of these things. Warn them before God against quarreling about words; it is of no value, and only ruins those who listen. <sup>15</sup> Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a workman who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth. <sup>16</sup> Avoid godless chatter, because those who indulge in it will become more and more ungodly. <sup>17</sup> Their teaching will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, <sup>18</sup> who have wandered away from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already taken place, and they destroy the faith of some. <sup>19</sup> Nevertheless, God's solid foundation stands firm, sealed with this inscription: "The Lord knows those who are his,"<sup></sup> and, "Everyone who confesses the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness." </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>20</sup> In a large house there are articles not only of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay; some are for noble purposes and some for ignoble. <sup>21</sup> If a man cleanses himself from the latter, he will be an instrument for noble purposes, made holy, useful to the Master and prepared to do any good work. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>22</sup> Flee the evil desires of youth, and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. <sup>23</sup> Don't have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments, because you know they produce quarrels. <sup>24</sup> And the Lord's servant must not quarrel; instead, he must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful. <sup>25</sup> Those who oppose him he must gently instruct, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth, <sup>26</sup> and that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will. </p> <br><h3>Proverbs 25:21-26:2</h3> <p></p><p>&nbsp;<sup>21</sup> If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if he is thirsty, give him water to drink. <br><sup>22</sup> In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the LORD will reward you. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>23</sup> As a north wind brings rain, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so a sly tongue brings angry looks. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>24</sup> Better to live on a corner of the roof <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than share a house with a quarrelsome wife. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>25</sup> Like cold water to a weary soul <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is good news from a distant land. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>26</sup> Like a muddied spring or a polluted well <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a righteous man who gives way to the wicked. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>27</sup> It is not good to eat too much honey, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor is it honorable to seek one's own honor. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>28</sup> Like a city whose walls are broken down <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a man who lacks self-control. </p><h4>Proverbs 26</h4><p>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> Like snow in summer or rain in harvest, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;honor is not fitting for a fool. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> Like a fluttering sparrow or a darting swallow, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an undeserved curse does not come to rest. </p><br>
