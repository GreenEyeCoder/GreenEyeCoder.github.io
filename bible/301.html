		<h3>Lamentations 1-2:6</h3> <p><h4>Lamentations 1</h4><p>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> <sup></sup>How deserted lies the city, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;once so full of people! <br />How like a widow is she, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who once was great among the nations! <br />She who was queen among the provinces <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has now become a slave. <p>&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> Bitterly she weeps at night, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tears are upon her cheeks. <br />Among all her lovers <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is none to comfort her. <br />All her friends have betrayed her; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they have become her enemies. <p>&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> After affliction and harsh labor, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judah has gone into exile. <br />She dwells among the nations; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she finds no resting place. <br />All who pursue her have overtaken her <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the midst of her distress. <p>&nbsp;<sup>4</sup> The roads to Zion mourn, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for no one comes to her appointed feasts. <br />All her gateways are desolate, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her priests groan, <br />her maidens grieve, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and she is in bitter anguish. <p>&nbsp;<sup>5</sup> Her foes have become her masters; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her enemies are at ease. <br />The LORD has brought her grief <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of her many sins. <br />Her children have gone into exile, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;captive before the foe. <p>&nbsp;<sup>6</sup> All the splendor has departed <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the Daughter of Zion. <br />Her princes are like deer <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that find no pasture; <br />in weakness they have fled <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before the pursuer. <p>&nbsp;<sup>7</sup> In the days of her affliction and wandering <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerusalem remembers all the treasures <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that were hers in days of old. <br />When her people fell into enemy hands, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there was no one to help her. <br />Her enemies looked at her <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and laughed at her destruction. <p>&nbsp;<sup>8</sup> Jerusalem has sinned greatly <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and so has become unclean. <br />All who honored her despise her, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for they have seen her nakedness; <br />she herself groans <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and turns away. <p>&nbsp;<sup>9</sup> Her filthiness clung to her skirts; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she did not consider her future. <br />Her fall was astounding; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there was none to comfort her. <br />"Look, O LORD, on my affliction, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the enemy has triumphed." <p>&nbsp;<sup>10</sup> The enemy laid hands <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on all her treasures; <br />she saw pagan nations <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enter her sanctuaryâ€” <br />those you had forbidden <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to enter your assembly. <p>&nbsp;<sup>11</sup> All her people groan <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as they search for bread; <br />they barter their treasures for food <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to keep themselves alive. <br />"Look, O LORD, and consider, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for I am despised." <p>&nbsp;<sup>12</sup> "Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look around and see. <br />Is any suffering like my suffering <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that was inflicted on me, <br />that the LORD brought on me <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the day of his fierce anger? <p>&nbsp;<sup>13</sup> "From on high he sent fire, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sent it down into my bones. <br />He spread a net for my feet <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and turned me back. <br />He made me desolate, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;faint all the day long. <p>&nbsp;<sup>14</sup> "My sins have been bound into a yoke<sup></sup>; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by his hands they were woven together. <br />They have come upon my neck <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the Lord has sapped my strength. <br />He has handed me over <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to those I cannot withstand. <p>&nbsp;<sup>15</sup> "The Lord has rejected <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the warriors in my midst; <br />he has summoned an army against me <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to<sup></sup> crush my young men. <br />In his winepress the Lord has trampled <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Virgin Daughter of Judah. <p>&nbsp;<sup>16</sup> "This is why I weep <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my eyes overflow with tears. <br />No one is near to comfort me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no one to restore my spirit. <br />My children are destitute <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because the enemy has prevailed." <p>&nbsp;<sup>17</sup> Zion stretches out her hands, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but there is no one to comfort her. <br />The LORD has decreed for Jacob <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that his neighbors become his foes; <br />Jerusalem has become <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an unclean thing among them. <p>&nbsp;<sup>18</sup> "The LORD is righteous, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet I rebelled against his command. <br />Listen, all you peoples; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;look upon my suffering. <br />My young men and maidens <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have gone into exile. <p>&nbsp;<sup>19</sup> "I called to my allies <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they betrayed me. <br />My priests and my elders <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perished in the city <br />while they searched for food <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to keep themselves alive. <p>&nbsp;<sup>20</sup> "See, O LORD, how distressed I am! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in torment within, <br />and in my heart I am disturbed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for I have been most rebellious. <br />Outside, the sword bereaves; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inside, there is only death. <p>&nbsp;<sup>21</sup> "People have heard my groaning, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but there is no one to comfort me. <br />All my enemies have heard of my distress; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they rejoice at what you have done. <br />May you bring the day you have announced <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so they may become like me. <p>&nbsp;<sup>22</sup> "Let all their wickedness come before you; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deal with them <br />as you have dealt with me <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of all my sins. <br />My groans are many <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my heart is faint." <h4>Lamentations 2</h4><p>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> <sup></sup>How the Lord has covered the Daughter of Zion <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the cloud of his anger<sup></sup>! <br />He has hurled down the splendor of Israel <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from heaven to earth; <br />he has not remembered his footstool <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the day of his anger. <p>&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> Without pity the Lord has swallowed up <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the dwellings of Jacob; <br />in his wrath he has torn down <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the strongholds of the Daughter of Judah. <br />He has brought her kingdom and its princes <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;down to the ground in dishonor. <p>&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> In fierce anger he has cut off <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every horn<sup></sup> of Israel. <br />He has withdrawn his right hand <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the approach of the enemy. <br />He has burned in Jacob like a flaming fire <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that consumes everything around it. <p>&nbsp;<sup>4</sup> Like an enemy he has strung his bow; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his right hand is ready. <br />Like a foe he has slain <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all who were pleasing to the eye; <br />he has poured out his wrath like fire <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the tent of the Daughter of Zion. <p>&nbsp;<sup>5</sup> The Lord is like an enemy; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he has swallowed up Israel. <br />He has swallowed up all her palaces <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and destroyed her strongholds. <br />He has multiplied mourning and lamentation <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the Daughter of Judah. <p>&nbsp;<sup>6</sup> He has laid waste his dwelling like a garden; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he has destroyed his place of meeting. <br />The LORD has made Zion forget <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her appointed feasts and her Sabbaths; <br />in his fierce anger he has spurned <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;both king and priest. </p> <br>

		<h3>Titus 3:1-15</h3><div> <p><h4>Titus 3</h4>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> Remind the people to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready to do whatever is good, <sup>2</sup> to slander no one, to be peaceable and considerate, and to show true humility toward all men. <p>&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> At one time we too were foolish, disobedient, deceived and enslaved by all kinds of passions and pleasures. We lived in malice and envy, being hated and hating one another. <sup>4</sup> But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared, <sup>5</sup> he saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy. He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit, <sup>6</sup> whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior, <sup>7</sup> so that, having been justified by his grace, we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life. <sup>8</sup> This is a trustworthy saying. And I want you to stress these things, so that those who have trusted in God may be careful to devote themselves to doing what is good. These things are excellent and profitable for everyone. <p>&nbsp;<sup>9</sup> But avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and arguments and quarrels about the law, because these are unprofitable and useless. <sup>10</sup> Warn a divisive person once, and then warn him a second time. After that, have nothing to do with him. <sup>11</sup> You may be sure that such a man is warped and sinful; he is self-condemned. &nbsp;<sup>12</sup> As soon as I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, do your best to come to me at Nicopolis, because I have decided to winter there. <sup>13</sup> Do everything you can to help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way and see that they have everything they need. <sup>14</sup> Our people must learn to devote themselves to doing what is good, in order that they may provide for daily necessities and not live unproductive lives. <p>&nbsp;<sup>15</sup> Everyone with me sends you greetings. Greet those who love us in the faith. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grace be with you all. </p><br><h3>Psalm 119:113-120</h3> <p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<sup>113</sup> I hate double-minded men, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but I love your law. <br /><sup>114</sup> You are my refuge and my shield; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have put my hope in your word. <br /><sup>115</sup> Away from me, you evildoers, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I may keep the commands of my God! <br /><sup>116</sup> Sustain me according to your promise, and I will live; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do not let my hopes be dashed. <br /><sup>117</sup> Uphold me, and I will be delivered; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will always have regard for your decrees. <br /><sup>118</sup> You reject all who stray from your decrees, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for their deceitfulness is in vain. <br /><sup>119</sup> All the wicked of the earth you discard like dross; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore I love your statutes. <br /><sup>120</sup> My flesh trembles in fear of you; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stand in awe of your laws. </p><br>
