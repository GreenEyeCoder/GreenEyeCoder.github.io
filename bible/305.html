<h3>Joel 1-2:17</h3> <p></p><h4>Joel 1</h4><p>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> The word of the LORD that came to Joel son of Pethuel. &nbsp;<sup>2</sup> Hear this, you elders; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;listen, all who live in the land. <br>Has anything like this ever happened in your days <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or in the days of your forefathers? <br><sup>3</sup> Tell it to your children, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and let your children tell it to their children, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their children to the next generation. <br><sup>4</sup> What the locust swarm has left <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the great locusts have eaten; <br>what the great locusts have left <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the young locusts have eaten; <br>what the young locusts have left <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other locusts<sup></sup> have eaten. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>5</sup> Wake up, you drunkards, and weep! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wail, all you drinkers of wine; <br>wail because of the new wine, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for it has been snatched from your lips. <br><sup>6</sup> A nation has invaded my land, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;powerful and without number; <br>it has the teeth of a lion, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fangs of a lioness. <br><sup>7</sup> It has laid waste my vines <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and ruined my fig trees. <br>It has stripped off their bark <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and thrown it away, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leaving their branches white. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>8</sup> Mourn like a virgin<sup></sup> in sackcloth <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grieving for the husband<sup></sup> of her youth. <br><sup>9</sup> Grain offerings and drink offerings <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are cut off from the house of the LORD. <br>The priests are in mourning, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those who minister before the LORD. <br><sup>10</sup> The fields are ruined, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ground is dried up<sup></sup>; <br>the grain is destroyed, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the new wine is dried up, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the oil fails. <br><sup>11</sup> Despair, you farmers, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wail, you vine growers; <br>grieve for the wheat and the barley, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because the harvest of the field is destroyed. <br><sup>12</sup> The vine is dried up <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the fig tree is withered; <br>the pomegranate, the palm and the apple tree— <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the trees of the field—are dried up. <br>Surely the joy of mankind <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is withered away. &nbsp;<sup>13</sup> Put on sackcloth, O priests, and mourn; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wail, you who minister before the altar. <br>Come, spend the night in sackcloth, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you who minister before my God; <br>for the grain offerings and drink offerings <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are withheld from the house of your God. <br><sup>14</sup> Declare a holy fast; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;call a sacred assembly. <br>Summon the elders <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all who live in the land <br>to the house of the LORD your God, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and cry out to the LORD. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>15</sup> Alas for that day! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the day of the LORD is near; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it will come like destruction from the Almighty.<sup></sup> </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>16</sup> Has not the food been cut off <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before our very eyes— <br>joy and gladness <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the house of our God? <br><sup>17</sup> The seeds are shriveled <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beneath the clods.<sup></sup> <br>The storehouses are in ruins, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the granaries have been broken down, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the grain has dried up. <br><sup>18</sup> How the cattle moan! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The herds mill about <br>because they have no pasture; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even the flocks of sheep are suffering. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>19</sup> To you, O LORD, I call, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for fire has devoured the open pastures <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and flames have burned up all the trees of the field. <br><sup>20</sup> Even the wild animals pant for you; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the streams of water have dried up <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and fire has devoured the open pastures. </p><h4>Joel 2</h4>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> Blow the trumpet in Zion; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sound the alarm on my holy hill. <br>Let all who live in the land tremble, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the day of the LORD is coming. <br>It is close at hand— <br>&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> a day of darkness and gloom, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a day of clouds and blackness. <br>Like dawn spreading across the mountains <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a large and mighty army comes, <br>such as never was of old <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor ever will be in ages to come. <p>&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> Before them fire devours, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;behind them a flame blazes. <br>Before them the land is like the garden of Eden, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;behind them, a desert waste— <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nothing escapes them. <br><sup>4</sup> They have the appearance of horses; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they gallop along like cavalry. <br><sup>5</sup> With a noise like that of chariots <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they leap over the mountaintops, <br>like a crackling fire consuming stubble, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a mighty army drawn up for battle. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>6</sup> At the sight of them, nations are in anguish; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every face turns pale. <br><sup>7</sup> They charge like warriors; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they scale walls like soldiers. <br>They all march in line, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not swerving from their course. <br><sup>8</sup> They do not jostle each other; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each marches straight ahead. <br>They plunge through defenses <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without breaking ranks. <br><sup>9</sup> They rush upon the city; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they run along the wall. <br>They climb into the houses; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like thieves they enter through the windows. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>10</sup> Before them the earth shakes, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sky trembles, <br>the sun and moon are darkened, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the stars no longer shine. <br><sup>11</sup> The LORD thunders <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the head of his army; <br>his forces are beyond number, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and mighty are those who obey his command. <br>The day of the LORD is great; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is dreadful. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who can endure it? &nbsp;<sup>12</sup> "Even now," declares the LORD, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"return to me with all your heart, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with fasting and weeping and mourning." </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>13</sup> Rend your heart <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and not your garments. <br>Return to the LORD your God, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for he is gracious and compassionate, <br>slow to anger and abounding in love, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he relents from sending calamity. <br><sup>14</sup> Who knows? He may turn and have pity <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and leave behind a blessing— <br>grain offerings and drink offerings <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the LORD your God. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>15</sup> Blow the trumpet in Zion, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declare a holy fast, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;call a sacred assembly. <br><sup>16</sup> Gather the people, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consecrate the assembly; <br>bring together the elders, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gather the children, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those nursing at the breast. <br>Let the bridegroom leave his room <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the bride her chamber. <br><sup>17</sup> Let the priests, who minister before the LORD, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weep between the temple porch and the altar. <br>Let them say, "Spare your people, O LORD. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not make your inheritance an object of scorn, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a byword among the nations. <br>Why should they say among the peoples, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"˜Where is their God?'" </p> <br>

<a id= "NT"></a><h3>Hebrews 3:1-19</h3> <p></p><h4>Hebrews 3</h4>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> Therefore, holy brothers, who share in the heavenly calling, fix your thoughts on Jesus, the apostle and high priest whom we confess. <sup>2</sup> He was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses was faithful in all God's house. <sup>3</sup> Jesus has been found worthy of greater honor than Moses, just as the builder of a house has greater honor than the house itself. <sup>4</sup> For every house is built by someone, but God is the builder of everything. <sup>5</sup> Moses was faithful as a servant in all God's house, testifying to what would be said in the future. <sup>6</sup> But Christ is faithful as a son over God's house. And we are his house, if we hold on to our courage and the hope of which we boast. &nbsp;<sup>7</sup> So, as the Holy Spirit says: <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today, if you hear his voice, <br>&nbsp;<sup>8</sup> do not harden your hearts <br>as you did in the rebellion, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;during the time of testing in the desert, <br><sup>9</sup> where your fathers tested and tried me <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and for forty years saw what I did. <br><sup>10</sup> That is why I was angry with that generation, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I said, "˜Their hearts are always going astray, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they have not known my ways.' <br><sup>11</sup> So I declared on oath in my anger, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"˜They shall never enter my rest.' "<sup></sup> </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>12</sup> See to it, brothers, that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God. <sup>13</sup> But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called Today, so that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness. <sup>14</sup> We have come to share in Christ if we hold firmly till the end the confidence we had at first. <sup>15</sup> As has just been said: </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today, if you hear his voice, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do not harden your hearts <br>as you did in the rebellion."<sup></sup> </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>16</sup> Who were they who heard and rebelled? Were they not all those Moses led out of Egypt? <sup>17</sup> And with whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the desert? <sup>18</sup> And to whom did God swear that they would never enter his rest if not to those who disobeyed<sup></sup>? <sup>19</sup> So we see that they were not able to enter, because of their unbelief. </p> <br><h3>Psalm 119:137-144</h3> <p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<sup>137</sup> Righteous are you, O LORD, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your laws are right. <br><sup>138</sup> The statutes you have laid down are righteous; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are fully trustworthy. <br><sup>139</sup> My zeal wears me out, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for my enemies ignore your words. <br><sup>140</sup> Your promises have been thoroughly tested, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your servant loves them. <br><sup>141</sup> Though I am lowly and despised, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not forget your precepts. <br><sup>142</sup> Your righteousness is everlasting <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your law is true. <br><sup>143</sup> Trouble and distress have come upon me, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but your commands are my delight. <br><sup>144</sup> Your statutes are forever right; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;give me understanding that I may live. </p><br></div><!--closing tags for 2ndcolumn-->
