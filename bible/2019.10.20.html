            <h3>Jeremiah 43-45:5</h3><h4>Jeremiah 43</h4><p>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> When Jeremiah finished telling the people all the words of the LORD their God—everything the LORD had sent him to tell them— <sup>2</sup> Azariah son of Hoshaiah and Johanan son of Kareah and all the arrogant men said to Jeremiah, "You are lying! The LORD our God has not sent you to say, "˜You must not go to Egypt to settle there.' <sup>3</sup> But Baruch son of Neriah is inciting you against us to hand us over to the Babylonians,<sup></sup> so they may kill us or carry us into exile to Babylon." </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>4</sup> So Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers and all the people disobeyed the LORD's command to stay in the land of Judah. <sup>5</sup> Instead, Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers led away all the remnant of Judah who had come back to live in the land of Judah from all the nations where they had been scattered. <sup>6</sup> They also led away all the men, women and children and the king's daughters whom Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard had left with Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch son of Neriah. <sup>7</sup> So they entered Egypt in disobedience to the LORD and went as far as Tahpanhes. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>8</sup> In Tahpanhes the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: <sup>9</sup> "While the Jews are watching, take some large stones with you and bury them in clay in the brick pavement at the entrance to Pharaoh's palace in Tahpanhes. <sup>10</sup> Then say to them, "˜This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I will send for my servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and I will set his throne over these stones I have buried here; he will spread his royal canopy above them. <sup>11</sup> He will come and attack Egypt, bringing death to those destined for death, captivity to those destined for captivity, and the sword to those destined for the sword. <sup>12</sup> He<sup></sup> will set fire to the temples of the gods of Egypt; he will burn their temples and take their gods captive. As a shepherd wraps his garment around him, so will he wrap Egypt around himself and depart from there unscathed. <sup>13</sup> There in the temple of the sun<sup></sup> in Egypt he will demolish the sacred pillars and will burn down the temples of the gods of Egypt.'" </p><h4>Jeremiah 44</h4>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> This word came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews living in Lower Egypt—in Migdol, Tahpanhes and Memphis<sup></sup>—and in Upper Egypt<sup></sup>: <sup>2</sup> "This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: You saw the great disaster I brought on Jerusalem and on all the towns of Judah. Today they lie deserted and in ruins <sup>3</sup> because of the evil they have done. They provoked me to anger by burning incense and by worshiping other gods that neither they nor you nor your fathers ever knew. <sup>4</sup> Again and again I sent my servants the prophets, who said, "˜Do not do this detestable thing that I hate!' <sup>5</sup> But they did not listen or pay attention; they did not turn from their wickedness or stop burning incense to other gods. <sup>6</sup> Therefore, my fierce anger was poured out; it raged against the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem and made them the desolate ruins they are today. <p>&nbsp;<sup>7</sup> "Now this is what the LORD God Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Why bring such great disaster on yourselves by cutting off from Judah the men and women, the children and infants, and so leave yourselves without a remnant? <sup>8</sup> Why provoke me to anger with what your hands have made, burning incense to other gods in Egypt, where you have come to live? You will destroy yourselves and make yourselves an object of cursing and reproach among all the nations on earth. <sup>9</sup> Have you forgotten the wickedness committed by your fathers and by the kings and queens of Judah and the wickedness committed by you and your wives in the land of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem? <sup>10</sup> To this day they have not humbled themselves or shown reverence, nor have they followed my law and the decrees I set before you and your fathers. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>11</sup> "Therefore, this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I am determined to bring disaster on you and to destroy all Judah. <sup>12</sup> I will take away the remnant of Judah who were determined to go to Egypt to settle there. They will all perish in Egypt; they will fall by the sword or die from famine. From the least to the greatest, they will die by sword or famine. They will become an object of cursing and horror, of condemnation and reproach. <sup>13</sup> I will punish those who live in Egypt with the sword, famine and plague, as I punished Jerusalem. <sup>14</sup> None of the remnant of Judah who have gone to live in Egypt will escape or survive to return to the land of Judah, to which they long to return and live; none will return except a few fugitives." </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>15</sup> Then all the men who knew that their wives were burning incense to other gods, along with all the women who were present—a large assembly—and all the people living in Lower and Upper Egypt,<sup></sup> said to Jeremiah, <sup>16</sup> "We will not listen to the message you have spoken to us in the name of the LORD! <sup>17</sup> We will certainly do everything we said we would: We will burn incense to the Queen of Heaven and will pour out drink offerings to her just as we and our fathers, our kings and our officials did in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. At that time we had plenty of food and were well off and suffered no harm. <sup>18</sup> But ever since we stopped burning incense to the Queen of Heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have had nothing and have been perishing by sword and famine." </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>19</sup> The women added, "When we burned incense to the Queen of Heaven and poured out drink offerings to her, did not our husbands know that we were making cakes like her image and pouring out drink offerings to her?" </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>20</sup> Then Jeremiah said to all the people, both men and women, who were answering him, <sup>21</sup> "Did not the LORD remember and think about the incense burned in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem by you and your fathers, your kings and your officials and the people of the land? <sup>22</sup> When the LORD could no longer endure your wicked actions and the detestable things you did, your land became an object of cursing and a desolate waste without inhabitants, as it is today. <sup>23</sup> Because you have burned incense and have sinned against the LORD and have not obeyed him or followed his law or his decrees or his stipulations, this disaster has come upon you, as you now see." </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>24</sup> Then Jeremiah said to all the people, including the women, "Hear the word of the LORD, all you people of Judah in Egypt. <sup>25</sup> This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: You and your wives have shown by your actions what you promised when you said, "˜We will certainly carry out the vows we made to burn incense and pour out drink offerings to the Queen of Heaven.' </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go ahead then, do what you promised! Keep your vows! <sup>26</sup> But hear the word of the LORD, all Jews living in Egypt: "˜I swear by my great name,' says the LORD, "˜that no one from Judah living anywhere in Egypt will ever again invoke my name or swear, "As surely as the Sovereign LORD lives." <sup>27</sup> For I am watching over them for harm, not for good; the Jews in Egypt will perish by sword and famine until they are all destroyed. <sup>28</sup> Those who escape the sword and return to the land of Judah from Egypt will be very few. Then the whole remnant of Judah who came to live in Egypt will know whose word will stand—mine or theirs. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>29</sup> ""˜This will be the sign to you that I will punish you in this place,' declares the LORD, "˜so that you will know that my threats of harm against you will surely stand.' <sup>30</sup> This is what the LORD says: "˜I am going to hand Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt over to his enemies who seek his life, just as I handed Zedekiah king of Judah over to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the enemy who was seeking his life.'" </p><h4>Jeremiah 45</h4>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> This is what Jeremiah the prophet told Baruch son of Neriah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, after Baruch had written on a scroll the words Jeremiah was then dictating: <sup>2</sup> "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says to you, Baruch: <sup>3</sup> You said, "˜Woe to me! The LORD has added sorrow to my pain; I am worn out with groaning and find no rest.'" <p>&nbsp;<sup>4</sup> The LORD said, "Say this to him: "˜This is what the LORD says: I will overthrow what I have built and uproot what I have planted, throughout the land. <sup>5</sup> Should you then seek great things for yourself? Seek them not. For I will bring disaster on all people, declares the LORD, but wherever you go I will let you escape with your life.'" </p>

            <h3>1 Timothy 5-6:2</h3><div> <p></p><h4>1 Timothy 5</h4>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> Do not rebuke an older man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as brothers, <sup>2</sup> older women as mothers, and younger women as sisters, with absolute purity. <p>&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> Give proper recognition to those widows who are really in need. <sup>4</sup> But if a widow has children or grandchildren, these should learn first of all to put their religion into practice by caring for their own family and so repaying their parents and grandparents, for this is pleasing to God. <sup>5</sup> The widow who is really in need and left all alone puts her hope in God and continues night and day to pray and to ask God for help. <sup>6</sup> But the widow who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives. <sup>7</sup> Give the people these instructions, too, so that no one may be open to blame. <sup>8</sup> If anyone does not provide for his relatives, and especially for his immediate family, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>9</sup> No widow may be put on the list of widows unless she is over sixty, has been faithful to her husband,<sup></sup> <sup>10</sup> and is well known for her good deeds, such as bringing up children, showing hospitality, washing the feet of the saints, helping those in trouble and devoting herself to all kinds of good deeds. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>11</sup> As for younger widows, do not put them on such a list. For when their sensual desires overcome their dedication to Christ, they want to marry. <sup>12</sup> Thus they bring judgment on themselves, because they have broken their first pledge. <sup>13</sup> Besides, they get into the habit of being idle and going about from house to house. And not only do they become idlers, but also gossips and busybodies, saying things they ought not to. <sup>14</sup> So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander. <sup>15</sup> Some have in fact already turned away to follow Satan. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>16</sup> If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family, she should help them and not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows who are really in need. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>17</sup> The elders who direct the affairs of the church well are worthy of double honor, especially those whose work is preaching and teaching. <sup>18</sup> For the Scripture says, "Do not muzzle the ox while it is treading out the grain,"<sup></sup> and "The worker deserves his wages."<sup></sup> <sup>19</sup> Do not entertain an accusation against an elder unless it is brought by two or three witnesses. <sup>20</sup> Those who sin are to be rebuked publicly, so that the others may take warning. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>21</sup> I charge you, in the sight of God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels, to keep these instructions without partiality, and to do nothing out of favoritism. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>22</sup> Do not be hasty in the laying on of hands, and do not share in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>23</sup> Stop drinking only water, and use a little wine because of your stomach and your frequent illnesses. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>24</sup> The sins of some men are obvious, reaching the place of judgment ahead of them; the sins of others trail behind them. <sup>25</sup> In the same way, good deeds are obvious, and even those that are not cannot be hidden. </p><h4>1 Timothy 6</h4><p>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> All who are under the yoke of slavery should consider their masters worthy of full respect, so that God's name and our teaching may not be slandered. <sup>2</sup> Those who have believing masters are not to show less respect for them because they are brothers. Instead, they are to serve them even better, because those who benefit from their service are believers, and dear to them. These are the things you are to teach and urge on them. </p> </div><br><h3>Psalm 119:64-72</h3><div> <p><br><sup>64</sup> The earth is filled with your love, O LORD; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;teach me your decrees. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<sup>65</sup> Do good to your servant <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;according to your word, O LORD. <br><sup>66</sup> Teach me knowledge and good judgment, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for I believe in your commands. <br><sup>67</sup> Before I was afflicted I went astray, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but now I obey your word. <br><sup>68</sup> You are good, and what you do is good; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;teach me your decrees. <br><sup>69</sup> Though the arrogant have smeared me with lies, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I keep your precepts with all my heart. <br><sup>70</sup> Their hearts are callous and unfeeling, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but I delight in your law. <br><sup>71</sup> It was good for me to be afflicted <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that I might learn your decrees. <br><sup>72</sup> The law from your mouth is more precious to me <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than thousands of pieces of silver and gold. </p></div><br>
