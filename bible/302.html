<h3>Lamentations 2:7-3:39</h3> <p><p>&nbsp;<sup>7</sup> The Lord has rejected his altar <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and abandoned his sanctuary. <br />He has handed over to the enemy <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the walls of her palaces; <br />they have raised a shout in the house of the LORD <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as on the day of an appointed feast. <p>&nbsp;<sup>8</sup> The LORD determined to tear down <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the wall around the Daughter of Zion. <br />He stretched out a measuring line <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and did not withhold his hand from destroying. <br />He made ramparts and walls lament; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;together they wasted away. <p>&nbsp;<sup>9</sup> Her gates have sunk into the ground; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their bars he has broken and destroyed. <br />Her king and her princes are exiled among the nations, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the law is no more, <br />and her prophets no longer find <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;visions from the LORD. <p>&nbsp;<sup>10</sup> The elders of the Daughter of Zion <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sit on the ground in silence; <br />they have sprinkled dust on their heads <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and put on sackcloth. <br />The young women of Jerusalem <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have bowed their heads to the ground. <p>&nbsp;<sup>11</sup> My eyes fail from weeping, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in torment within, <br />my heart is poured out on the ground <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because my people are destroyed, <br />because children and infants faint <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the streets of the city. <p>&nbsp;<sup>12</sup> They say to their mothers, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is bread and wine?" <br />as they faint like wounded men <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the streets of the city, <br />as their lives ebb away <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in their mothers' arms. <p>&nbsp;<sup>13</sup> What can I say for you? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With what can I compare you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Daughter of Jerusalem? <br />To what can I liken you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I may comfort you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Virgin Daughter of Zion? <br />Your wound is as deep as the sea. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who can heal you? <p>&nbsp;<sup>14</sup> The visions of your prophets <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were false and worthless; <br />they did not expose your sin <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to ward off your captivity. <br />The oracles they gave you <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were false and misleading. <p>&nbsp;<sup>15</sup> All who pass your way <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clap their hands at you; <br />they scoff and shake their heads <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the Daughter of Jerusalem: <br />"Is this the city that was called <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the perfection of beauty, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the joy of the whole earth?" <p>&nbsp;<sup>16</sup> All your enemies open their mouths <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wide against you; <br />they scoff and gnash their teeth <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and say, "We have swallowed her up. <br />This is the day we have waited for; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we have lived to see it." <p>&nbsp;<sup>17</sup> The LORD has done what he planned; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he has fulfilled his word, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which he decreed long ago. <br />He has overthrown you without pity, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he has let the enemy gloat over you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he has exalted the horn<sup></sup> of your foes. <p>&nbsp;<sup>18</sup> The hearts of the people <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cry out to the Lord. <br />O wall of the Daughter of Zion, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let your tears flow like a river <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day and night; <br />give yourself no relief, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your eyes no rest. <p>&nbsp;<sup>19</sup> Arise, cry out in the night, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as the watches of the night begin; <br />pour out your heart like water <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the presence of the Lord. <br />Lift up your hands to him <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the lives of your children, <br />who faint from hunger <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the head of every street. <p>&nbsp;<sup>20</sup> "Look, O LORD, and consider: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom have you ever treated like this? <br />Should women eat their offspring, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the children they have cared for? <br />Should priest and prophet be killed <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the sanctuary of the Lord? <p>&nbsp;<sup>21</sup> "Young and old lie together <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the dust of the streets; <br />my young men and maidens <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have fallen by the sword. <br />You have slain them in the day of your anger; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you have slaughtered them without pity. <p>&nbsp;<sup>22</sup> "As you summon to a feast day, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so you summoned against me terrors on every side. <br />In the day of the LORD's anger <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no one escaped or survived; <br />those I cared for and reared, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my enemy has destroyed." <h4>Lamentations 3</h4><p>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> <sup></sup>I am the man who has seen affliction <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the rod of his wrath. <br /><sup>2</sup> He has driven me away and made me walk <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in darkness rather than light; <br /><sup>3</sup> indeed, he has turned his hand against me <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;again and again, all day long. <p>&nbsp;<sup>4</sup> He has made my skin and my flesh grow old <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and has broken my bones. <br /><sup>5</sup> He has besieged me and surrounded me <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with bitterness and hardship. <br /><sup>6</sup> He has made me dwell in darkness <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like those long dead. <p>&nbsp;<sup>7</sup> He has walled me in so I cannot escape; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he has weighed me down with chains. <br /><sup>8</sup> Even when I call out or cry for help, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he shuts out my prayer. <br /><sup>9</sup> He has barred my way with blocks of stone; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he has made my paths crooked. <p>&nbsp;<sup>10</sup> Like a bear lying in wait, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a lion in hiding, <br /><sup>11</sup> he dragged me from the path and mangled me <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and left me without help. <br /><sup>12</sup> He drew his bow <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and made me the target for his arrows. <p>&nbsp;<sup>13</sup> He pierced my heart <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with arrows from his quiver. <br /><sup>14</sup> I became the laughingstock of all my people; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they mock me in song all day long. <br /><sup>15</sup> He has filled me with bitter herbs <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and sated me with gall. <p>&nbsp;<sup>16</sup> He has broken my teeth with gravel; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he has trampled me in the dust. <br /><sup>17</sup> I have been deprived of peace; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have forgotten what prosperity is. <br /><sup>18</sup> So I say, "My splendor is gone <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all that I had hoped from the LORD." <p>&nbsp;<sup>19</sup> I remember my affliction and my wandering, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the bitterness and the gall. <br /><sup>20</sup> I well remember them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my soul is downcast within me. <br /><sup>21</sup> Yet this I call to mind <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and therefore I have hope: <p>&nbsp;<sup>22</sup> Because of the LORD's great love we are not consumed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for his compassions never fail. <br /><sup>23</sup> They are new every morning; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;great is your faithfulness. <br /><sup>24</sup> I say to myself, "The LORD is my portion; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore I will wait for him." <p>&nbsp;<sup>25</sup> The LORD is good to those whose hope is in him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the one who seeks him; <br /><sup>26</sup> it is good to wait quietly <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the salvation of the LORD. <br /><sup>27</sup> It is good for a man to bear the yoke <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while he is young. <p>&nbsp;<sup>28</sup> Let him sit alone in silence, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the LORD has laid it on him. <br /><sup>29</sup> Let him bury his face in the dust— <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there may yet be hope. <br /><sup>30</sup> Let him offer his cheek to one who would strike him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and let him be filled with disgrace. <p>&nbsp;<sup>31</sup> For men are not cast off <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the Lord forever. <br /><sup>32</sup> Though he brings grief, he will show compassion, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so great is his unfailing love. <br /><sup>33</sup> For he does not willingly bring affliction <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or grief to the children of men. <p>&nbsp;<sup>34</sup> To crush underfoot <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all prisoners in the land, <br /><sup>35</sup> to deny a man his rights <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before the Most High, <br /><sup>36</sup> to deprive a man of justice— <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would not the Lord see such things? <p>&nbsp;<sup>37</sup> Who can speak and have it happen <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the Lord has not decreed it? <br /><sup>38</sup> Is it not from the mouth of the Most High <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that both calamities and good things come? <br /><sup>39</sup> Why should any living man complain <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when punished for his sins? </p> <br>

<a id= "NT"></a><h3>Philemon 1:1-25</h3> <p><h4>Philemon 1</h4><p>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Philemon our dear friend and fellow worker, <sup>2</sup> to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier and to the church that meets in your home: <p>&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. &nbsp;<sup>4</sup> I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers, <sup>5</sup> because I hear about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints. <sup>6</sup> I pray that you may be active in sharing your faith, so that you will have a full understanding of every good thing we have in Christ. <sup>7</sup> Your love has given me great joy and encouragement, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the saints. &nbsp;<sup>8</sup> Therefore, although in Christ I could be bold and order you to do what you ought to do, <sup>9</sup> yet I appeal to you on the basis of love. I then, as Paul—an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus— <sup>10</sup> I appeal to you for my son Onesimus,<sup></sup> who became my son while I was in chains. <sup>11</sup> Formerly he was useless to you, but now he has become useful both to you and to me. <p>&nbsp;<sup>12</sup> I am sending him—who is my very heart—back to you. <sup>13</sup> I would have liked to keep him with me so that he could take your place in helping me while I am in chains for the gospel. <sup>14</sup> But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that any favor you do will be spontaneous and not forced. <sup>15</sup> Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back for good— <sup>16</sup> no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother. He is very dear to me but even dearer to you, both as a man and as a brother in the Lord. <p>&nbsp;<sup>17</sup> So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me. <sup>18</sup> If he has done you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to me. <sup>19</sup> I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand. I will pay it back—not to mention that you owe me your very self. <sup>20</sup> I do wish, brother, that I may have some benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ. <sup>21</sup> Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask. <p>&nbsp;<sup>22</sup> And one thing more: Prepare a guest room for me, because I hope to be restored to you in answer to your prayers. <p>&nbsp;<sup>23</sup> Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings. <sup>24</sup> And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my fellow workers. <p>&nbsp;<sup>25</sup> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. </p> <br><h3>Psalm 119:121-128</h3> <p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<sup>121</sup> I have done what is righteous and just; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do not leave me to my oppressors. <br /><sup>122</sup> Ensure your servant's well-being; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let not the arrogant oppress me. <br /><sup>123</sup> My eyes fail, looking for your salvation, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;looking for your righteous promise. <br /><sup>124</sup> Deal with your servant according to your love <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and teach me your decrees. <br /><sup>125</sup> I am your servant; give me discernment <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I may understand your statutes. <br /><sup>126</sup> It is time for you to act, O LORD; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your law is being broken. <br /><sup>127</sup> Because I love your commands <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more than gold, more than pure gold, <br /><sup>128</sup> and because I consider all your precepts right, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hate every wrong path. </p><br>
