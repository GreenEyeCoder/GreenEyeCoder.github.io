<h3>Ezekiel 1-3:27</h3> <p><h4>Ezekiel 1</h4>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> In the<sup></sup> thirtieth year, in the fourth month on the fifth day, while I was among the exiles by the Kebar River, the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God. <p>&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> On the fifth of the month—it was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin— <sup>3</sup> the word of the LORD came to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi,<sup></sup> by the Kebar River in the land of the Babylonians.<sup></sup> There the hand of the LORD was upon him. <p>&nbsp;<sup>4</sup> I looked, and I saw a windstorm coming out of the north—an immense cloud with flashing lightning and surrounded by brilliant light. The center of the fire looked like glowing metal, <sup>5</sup> and in the fire was what looked like four living creatures. In appearance their form was that of a man, <sup>6</sup> but each of them had four faces and four wings. <sup>7</sup> Their legs were straight; their feet were like those of a calf and gleamed like burnished bronze. <sup>8</sup> Under their wings on their four sides they had the hands of a man. All four of them had faces and wings, <sup>9</sup> and their wings touched one another. Each one went straight ahead; they did not turn as they moved. <p>&nbsp;<sup>10</sup> Their faces looked like this: Each of the four had the face of a man, and on the right side each had the face of a lion, and on the left the face of an ox; each also had the face of an eagle. <sup>11</sup> Such were their faces. Their wings were spread out upward; each had two wings, one touching the wing of another creature on either side, and two wings covering its body. <sup>12</sup> Each one went straight ahead. Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they went. <sup>13</sup> The appearance of the living creatures was like burning coals of fire or like torches. Fire moved back and forth among the creatures; it was bright, and lightning flashed out of it. <sup>14</sup> The creatures sped back and forth like flashes of lightning. <p>&nbsp;<sup>15</sup> As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each creature with its four faces. <sup>16</sup> This was the appearance and structure of the wheels: They sparkled like chrysolite, and all four looked alike. Each appeared to be made like a wheel intersecting a wheel. <sup>17</sup> As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the creatures faced; the wheels did not turn about<sup></sup> as the creatures went. <sup>18</sup> Their rims were high and awesome, and all four rims were full of eyes all around. <p>&nbsp;<sup>19</sup> When the living creatures moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the living creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose. <sup>20</sup> Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, and the wheels would rise along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. <sup>21</sup> When the creatures moved, they also moved; when the creatures stood still, they also stood still; and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels rose along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. <p>&nbsp;<sup>22</sup> Spread out above the heads of the living creatures was what looked like an expanse, sparkling like ice, and awesome. <sup>23</sup> Under the expanse their wings were stretched out one toward the other, and each had two wings covering its body. <sup>24</sup> When the creatures moved, I heard the sound of their wings, like the roar of rushing waters, like the voice of the Almighty,<sup></sup> like the tumult of an army. When they stood still, they lowered their wings. <p>&nbsp;<sup>25</sup> Then there came a voice from above the expanse over their heads as they stood with lowered wings. <sup>26</sup> Above the expanse over their heads was what looked like a throne of sapphire,<sup></sup> and high above on the throne was a figure like that of a man. <sup>27</sup> I saw that from what appeared to be his waist up he looked like glowing metal, as if full of fire, and that from there down he looked like fire; and brilliant light surrounded him. <sup>28</sup> Like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so was the radiance around him. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. When I saw it, I fell facedown, and I heard the voice of one speaking. <h4>Ezekiel 2</h4>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> He said to me, "Son of man, stand up on your feet and I will speak to you." <sup>2</sup> As he spoke, the Spirit came into me and raised me to my feet, and I heard him speaking to me. <p>&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> He said: "Son of man, I am sending you to the Israelites, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me; they and their fathers have been in revolt against me to this very day. <sup>4</sup> The people to whom I am sending you are obstinate and stubborn. Say to them, "˜This is what the Sovereign LORD says.' <sup>5</sup> And whether they listen or fail to listen—for they are a rebellious house—they will know that a prophet has been among them. <sup>6</sup> And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them or their words. Do not be afraid, though briers and thorns are all around you and you live among scorpions. Do not be afraid of what they say or terrified by them, though they are a rebellious house. <sup>7</sup> You must speak my words to them, whether they listen or fail to listen, for they are rebellious. <sup>8</sup> But you, son of man, listen to what I say to you. Do not rebel like that rebellious house; open your mouth and eat what I give you." <p>&nbsp;<sup>9</sup> Then I looked, and I saw a hand stretched out to me. In it was a scroll, <sup>10</sup> which he unrolled before me. On both sides of it were written words of lament and mourning and woe. <h4>Ezekiel 3</h4><p>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> And he said to me, "Son of man, eat what is before you, eat this scroll; then go and speak to the house of Israel." <sup>2</sup> So I opened my mouth, and he gave me the scroll to eat. <p>&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> Then he said to me, "Son of man, eat this scroll I am giving you and fill your stomach with it." So I ate it, and it tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth. <p>&nbsp;<sup>4</sup> He then said to me: "Son of man, go now to the house of Israel and speak my words to them. <sup>5</sup> You are not being sent to a people of obscure speech and difficult language, but to the house of Israel— <sup>6</sup> not to many peoples of obscure speech and difficult language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely if I had sent you to them, they would have listened to you. <sup>7</sup> But the house of Israel is not willing to listen to you because they are not willing to listen to me, for the whole house of Israel is hardened and obstinate. <sup>8</sup> But I will make you as unyielding and hardened as they are. <sup>9</sup> I will make your forehead like the hardest stone, harder than flint. Do not be afraid of them or terrified by them, though they are a rebellious house." <p>&nbsp;<sup>10</sup> And he said to me, "Son of man, listen carefully and take to heart all the words I speak to you. <sup>11</sup> Go now to your countrymen in exile and speak to them. Say to them, "˜This is what the Sovereign LORD says,' whether they listen or fail to listen." <p>&nbsp;<sup>12</sup> Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me a loud rumbling sound—May the glory of the LORD be praised in his dwelling place!— <sup>13</sup> the sound of the wings of the living creatures brushing against each other and the sound of the wheels beside them, a loud rumbling sound. <sup>14</sup> The Spirit then lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness and in the anger of my spirit, with the strong hand of the LORD upon me. <sup>15</sup> I came to the exiles who lived at Tel Abib near the Kebar River. And there, where they were living, I sat among them for seven days—overwhelmed. &nbsp;<sup>16</sup> At the end of seven days the word of the LORD came to me: <sup>17</sup> "Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; so hear the word I speak and give them warning from me. <sup>18</sup> When I say to a wicked man, "˜You will surely die,' and you do not warn him or speak out to dissuade him from his evil ways in order to save his life, that wicked man will die for<sup></sup> his sin, and I will hold you accountable for his blood. <sup>19</sup> But if you do warn the wicked man and he does not turn from his wickedness or from his evil ways, he will die for his sin; but you will have saved yourself. <p>&nbsp;<sup>20</sup> "Again, when a righteous man turns from his righteousness and does evil, and I put a stumbling block before him, he will die. Since you did not warn him, he will die for his sin. The righteous things he did will not be remembered, and I will hold you accountable for his blood. <sup>21</sup> But if you do warn the righteous man not to sin and he does not sin, he will surely live because he took warning, and you will have saved yourself." <p>&nbsp;<sup>22</sup> The hand of the LORD was upon me there, and he said to me, "Get up and go out to the plain, and there I will speak to you." <sup>23</sup> So I got up and went out to the plain. And the glory of the LORD was standing there, like the glory I had seen by the Kebar River, and I fell facedown. <p>&nbsp;<sup>24</sup> Then the Spirit came into me and raised me to my feet. He spoke to me and said: "Go, shut yourself inside your house. <sup>25</sup> And you, son of man, they will tie with ropes; you will be bound so that you cannot go out among the people. <sup>26</sup> I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be silent and unable to rebuke them, though they are a rebellious house. <sup>27</sup> But when I speak to you, I will open your mouth and you shall say to them, "˜This is what the Sovereign LORD says.' Whoever will listen let him listen, and whoever will refuse let him refuse; for they are a rebellious house. </p> <br><h3>Hebrews 4:14-5:10</h3> <p>&nbsp;<sup>14</sup> Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has gone through the heavens,<sup></sup> Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess. <sup>15</sup> For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet was without sin. <sup>16</sup> Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.

<a id= "NT"></a><h4>Hebrews 5</h4><p>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> Every high priest is selected from among men and is appointed to represent them in matters related to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. <sup>2</sup> He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and are going astray, since he himself is subject to weakness. <sup>3</sup> This is why he has to offer sacrifices for his own sins, as well as for the sins of the people. <p>&nbsp;<sup>4</sup> No one takes this honor upon himself; he must be called by God, just as Aaron was. <sup>5</sup> So Christ also did not take upon himself the glory of becoming a high priest. But God said to him, <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are my Son; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;today I have become your Father.<sup></sup>"<sup></sup> <p>&nbsp;<sup>6</sup> And he says in another place, <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a priest forever, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the order of Melchizedek."<sup></sup> <p>&nbsp;<sup>7</sup> During the days of Jesus' life on earth, he offered up prayers and petitions with loud cries and tears to the one who could save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission. <sup>8</sup> Although he was a son, he learned obedience from what he suffered <sup>9</sup> and, once made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him <sup>10</sup> and was designated by God to be high priest in the order of Melchizedek. </p> <br><h3>Psalm 119:153-160</h3> <p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<sup>153</sup> Look upon my suffering and deliver me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for I have not forgotten your law. <br /><sup>154</sup> Defend my cause and redeem me; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preserve my life according to your promise. <br /><sup>155</sup> Salvation is far from the wicked, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for they do not seek out your decrees. <br /><sup>156</sup> Your compassion is great, O LORD; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preserve my life according to your laws. <br /><sup>157</sup> Many are the foes who persecute me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but I have not turned from your statutes. <br /><sup>158</sup> I look on the faithless with loathing, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for they do not obey your word. <br /><sup>159</sup> See how I love your precepts; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preserve my life, O LORD, according to your love. <br /><sup>160</sup> All your words are true; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all your righteous laws are eternal. </p><br></div><!--closing tags for 2ndcolumn-->
