<h3>Obadiah 1-21</h3> <p><h4>Obadiah 1</h4><p>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> The vision of Obadiah. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what the Sovereign LORD says about Edom— <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard a message from the LORD: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An envoy was sent to the nations to say, <br />"Rise, and let us go against her for battle"— <p>&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> "See, I will make you small among the nations; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you will be utterly despised. <br /><sup>3</sup> The pride of your heart has deceived you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you who live in the clefts of the rocks<sup></sup> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and make your home on the heights, <br />you who say to yourself, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"˜Who can bring me down to the ground?' <br /><sup>4</sup> Though you soar like the eagle <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and make your nest among the stars, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from there I will bring you down," <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD. <br /><sup>5</sup> "If thieves came to you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if robbers in the night— <br />Oh, what a disaster awaits you— <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would they not steal only as much as they wanted? <br />If grape pickers came to you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would they not leave a few grapes? <br /><sup>6</sup> But how Esau will be ransacked, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his hidden treasures pillaged! <br /><sup>7</sup> All your allies will force you to the border; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your friends will deceive and overpower you; <br />those who eat your bread will set a trap for you,<sup></sup> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but you will not detect it. <p>&nbsp;<sup>8</sup> "In that day," declares the LORD, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"will I not destroy the wise men of Edom, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;men of understanding in the mountains of Esau? <br /><sup>9</sup> Your warriors, O Teman, will be terrified, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and everyone in Esau's mountains <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will be cut down in the slaughter. <br /><sup>10</sup> Because of the violence against your brother Jacob, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you will be covered with shame; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you will be destroyed forever. <br /><sup>11</sup> On the day you stood aloof <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while strangers carried off his wealth <br />and foreigners entered his gates <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and cast lots for Jerusalem, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you were like one of them. <br /><sup>12</sup> You should not look down on your brother <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the day of his misfortune, <br />nor rejoice over the people of Judah <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the day of their destruction, <br />nor boast so much <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the day of their trouble. <br /><sup>13</sup> You should not march through the gates of my people <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the day of their disaster, <br />nor look down on them in their calamity <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the day of their disaster, <br />nor seize their wealth <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the day of their disaster. <br /><sup>14</sup> You should not wait at the crossroads <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to cut down their fugitives, <br />nor hand over their survivors <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the day of their trouble. <p>&nbsp;<sup>15</sup> "The day of the LORD is near <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for all nations. <br />As you have done, it will be done to you; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your deeds will return upon your own head. <br /><sup>16</sup> Just as you drank on my holy hill, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so all the nations will drink continually; <br />they will drink and drink <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and be as if they had never been. <br /><sup>17</sup> But on Mount Zion will be deliverance; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it will be holy, <br />and the house of Jacob <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will possess its inheritance. <br /><sup>18</sup> The house of Jacob will be a fire <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the house of Joseph a flame; <br />the house of Esau will be stubble, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they will set it on fire and consume it. <br />There will be no survivors <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the house of Esau." <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LORD has spoken. <p>&nbsp;<sup>19</sup> People from the Negev will occupy <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the mountains of Esau, <br />and people from the foothills will possess <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the land of the Philistines. <br />They will occupy the fields of Ephraim and Samaria, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Benjamin will possess Gilead. <br /><sup>20</sup> This company of Israelite exiles who are in Canaan <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will possess the land as far as Zarephath; <br />the exiles from Jerusalem who are in Sepharad <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will possess the towns of the Negev. <br /><sup>21</sup> Deliverers will go up on<sup></sup> Mount Zion <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to govern the mountains of Esau. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the kingdom will be the LORD's. </p> <br>

<a id= "NT"></a><p><h3>Hebrews 2:1-18</h3><h4>Hebrews 2<h4>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> We must pay more careful attention, therefore, to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away. <sup>2</sup> For if the message spoken by angels was binding, and every violation and disobedience received its just punishment, <sup>3</sup> how shall we escape if we ignore such a great salvation? This salvation, which was first announced by the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard him. <sup>4</sup> God also testified to it by signs, wonders and various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will. &nbsp;<sup>5</sup> It is not to angels that he has subjected the world to come, about which we are speaking. <sup>6</sup> But there is a place where someone has testified: <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is man that you are mindful of him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of man that you care for him? <br /><sup>7</sup> You made him a little<sup></sup> lower than the angels; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you crowned him with glory and honor <br />&nbsp;<sup>8</sup> and put everything under his feet."<sup></sup> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In putting everything under him, God left nothing that is not subject to him. Yet at present we do not see everything subject to him. <sup>9</sup> But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone. <p>&nbsp;<sup>10</sup> In bringing many sons to glory, it was fitting that God, for whom and through whom everything exists, should make the author of their salvation perfect through suffering. <sup>11</sup> Both the one who makes men holy and those who are made holy are of the same family. So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers. <sup>12</sup> He says, <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will declare your name to my brothers; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the presence of the congregation I will sing your praises."<sup></sup> <p>&nbsp;<sup>13</sup> And again, <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will put my trust in him."<sup></sup> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And again he says, <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here am I, and the children God has given me."<sup></sup> <p>&nbsp;<sup>14</sup> Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might destroy him who holds the power of death—that is, the devil— <sup>15</sup> and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death. <sup>16</sup> For surely it is not angels he helps, but Abraham's descendants. <sup>17</sup> For this reason he had to be made like his brothers in every way, in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, and that he might make atonement for<sup></sup> the sins of the people. <sup>18</sup> Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted. </p> <br><h3>Proverbs 26:13-22</h3> <p><p>&nbsp;<sup>13</sup> The sluggard says, "There is a lion in the road, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a fierce lion roaming the streets!" <p>&nbsp;<sup>14</sup> As a door turns on its hinges, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so a sluggard turns on his bed. <p>&nbsp;<sup>15</sup> The sluggard buries his hand in the dish; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth. <p>&nbsp;<sup>16</sup> The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than seven men who answer discreetly. <p>&nbsp;<sup>17</sup> Like one who seizes a dog by the ears <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a passer-by who meddles in a quarrel not his own. <p>&nbsp;<sup>18</sup> Like a madman shooting <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;firebrands or deadly arrows <br /><sup>19</sup> is a man who deceives his neighbor <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and says, "I was only joking!" <p>&nbsp;<sup>20</sup> Without wood a fire goes out; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without gossip a quarrel dies down. <p>&nbsp;<sup>21</sup> As charcoal to embers and as wood to fire, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so is a quarrelsome man for kindling strife. <p>&nbsp;<sup>22</sup> The words of a gossip are like choice morsels; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they go down to a man's inmost parts. </p><br>
