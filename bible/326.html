<h3>Ezekiel 41-42:20</h3> <p><h4>Ezekiel 41</h4><p>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> Then the man brought me to the outer sanctuary and measured the jambs; the width of the jambs was six cubits<sup></sup> on each side.<sup></sup> <sup>2</sup> The entrance was ten cubits wide, and the projecting walls on each side of it were five cubits wide. He also measured the outer sanctuary; it was forty cubits long and twenty cubits wide. <p>&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> Then he went into the inner sanctuary and measured the jambs of the entrance; each was two cubits wide. The entrance was six cubits wide, and the projecting walls on each side of it were seven cubits wide. <sup>4</sup> And he measured the length of the inner sanctuary; it was twenty cubits, and its width was twenty cubits across the end of the outer sanctuary. He said to me, "This is the Most Holy Place.". <p>&nbsp;<sup>5</sup> Then he measured the wall of the temple; it was six cubits thick, and each side room around the temple was four cubits wide. <sup>6</sup> The side rooms were on three levels, one above another, thirty on each level. There were ledges all around the wall of the temple to serve as supports for the side rooms, so that the supports were not inserted into the wall of the temple. <sup>7</sup> The side rooms all around the temple were wider at each successive level. The structure surrounding the temple was built in ascending stages, so that the rooms widened as one went upward. A stairway went up from the lowest floor to the top floor through the middle floor. <p>&nbsp;<sup>8</sup> I saw that the temple had a raised base all around it, forming the foundation of the side rooms. It was the length of the rod, six long cubits. <sup>9</sup> The outer wall of the side rooms was five cubits thick. The open area between the side rooms of the temple <sup>10</sup> and the priests' rooms was twenty cubits wide all around the temple. <sup>11</sup> There were entrances to the side rooms from the open area, one on the north and another on the south; and the base adjoining the open area was five cubits wide all around. <p>&nbsp;<sup>12</sup> The building facing the temple courtyard on the west side was seventy cubits wide. The wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and its length was ninety cubits. <p>&nbsp;<sup>13</sup> Then he measured the temple; it was a hundred cubits long, and the temple courtyard and the building with its walls were also a hundred cubits long. <sup>14</sup> The width of the temple courtyard on the east, including the front of the temple, was a hundred cubits. <p>&nbsp;<sup>15</sup> Then he measured the length of the building facing the courtyard at the rear of the temple, including its galleries on each side; it was a hundred cubits. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outer sanctuary, the inner sanctuary and the portico facing the court, <sup>16</sup> as well as the thresholds and the narrow windows and galleries around the three of them—everything beyond and including the threshold was covered with wood. The floor, the wall up to the windows, and the windows were covered. <sup>17</sup> In the space above the outside of the entrance to the inner sanctuary and on the walls at regular intervals all around the inner and outer sanctuary <sup>18</sup> were carved cherubim and palm trees. Palm trees alternated with cherubim. Each cherub had two faces: <sup>19</sup> the face of a man toward the palm tree on one side and the face of a lion toward the palm tree on the other. They were carved all around the whole temple. <sup>20</sup> From the floor to the area above the entrance, cherubim and palm trees were carved on the wall of the outer sanctuary. <p>&nbsp;<sup>21</sup> The outer sanctuary had a rectangular doorframe, and the one at the front of the Most Holy Place was similar. <sup>22</sup> There was a wooden altar three cubits high and two cubits square<sup></sup>; its corners, its base<sup></sup> and its sides were of wood. The man said to me, "This is the table that is before the LORD.". <sup>23</sup> Both the outer sanctuary and the Most Holy Place had double doors. <sup>24</sup> Each door had two leaves—two hinged leaves for each door. <sup>25</sup> And on the doors of the outer sanctuary were carved cherubim and palm trees like those carved on the walls, and there was a wooden overhang on the front of the portico. <sup>26</sup> On the sidewalls of the portico were narrow windows with palm trees carved on each side. The side rooms of the temple also had overhangs. <h4>Ezekiel 42</h4>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> Then the man led me northward into the outer court and brought me to the rooms opposite the temple courtyard and opposite the outer wall on the north side. <sup>2</sup> The building whose door faced north was a hundred cubits<sup></sup> long and fifty cubits wide. <sup>3</sup> Both in the section twenty cubits from the inner court and in the section opposite the pavement of the outer court, gallery faced gallery at the three levels. <sup>4</sup> In front of the rooms was an inner passageway ten cubits wide and a hundred cubits<sup></sup> long. Their doors were on the north. <sup>5</sup> Now the upper rooms were narrower, for the galleries took more space from them than from the rooms on the lower and middle floors of the building. <sup>6</sup> The rooms on the third floor had no pillars, as the courts had; so they were smaller in floor space than those on the lower and middle floors. <sup>7</sup> There was an outer wall parallel to the rooms and the outer court; it extended in front of the rooms for fifty cubits. <sup>8</sup> While the row of rooms on the side next to the outer court was fifty cubits long, the row on the side nearest the sanctuary was a hundred cubits long. <sup>9</sup> The lower rooms had an entrance on the east side as one enters them from the outer court. <p>&nbsp;<sup>10</sup> On the south side<sup></sup> along the length of the wall of the outer court, adjoining the temple courtyard and opposite the outer wall, were rooms <sup>11</sup> with a passageway in front of them. These were like the rooms on the north; they had the same length and width, with similar exits and dimensions. Similar to the doorways on the north <sup>12</sup> were the doorways of the rooms on the south. There was a doorway at the beginning of the passageway that was parallel to the corresponding wall extending eastward, by which one enters the rooms. <p>&nbsp;<sup>13</sup> Then he said to me, "The north and south rooms facing the temple courtyard are the priests' rooms, where the priests who approach the LORD will eat the most holy offerings. There they will put the most holy offerings—the grain offerings, the sin offerings and the guilt offerings—for the place is holy. <sup>14</sup> Once the priests enter the holy precincts, they are not to go into the outer court until they leave behind the garments in which they minister, for these are holy. They are to put on other clothes before they go near the places that are for the people.". <p>&nbsp;<sup>15</sup> When he had finished measuring what was inside the temple area, he led me out by the east gate and measured the area all around: <sup>16</sup> He measured the east side with the measuring rod; it was five hundred cubits.<sup></sup> <sup>17</sup> He measured the north side; it was five hundred cubits<sup></sup> by the measuring rod. <sup>18</sup> He measured the south side; it was five hundred cubits by the measuring rod. <sup>19</sup> Then he turned to the west side and measured; it was five hundred cubits by the measuring rod. <sup>20</sup> So he measured the area on all four sides. It had a wall around it, five hundred cubits long and five hundred cubits wide, to separate the holy from the common. </p><br>

<a id= "NT"></a><h3>1 Peter 1-2:3</h3> <p><h4>1 Peter 1</h4><p>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To God's elect, strangers in the world, scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia, <sup>2</sup> who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and sprinkling by his blood: <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grace and peace be yours in abundance. &nbsp;<sup>3</sup> Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! In his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, <sup>4</sup> and into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil or fade—kept in heaven for you, <sup>5</sup> who through faith are shielded by God's power until the coming of the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time. <sup>6</sup> In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials. <sup>7</sup> These have come so that your faith—of greater worth than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire—may be proved genuine and may result in praise, glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed. <sup>8</sup> Though you have not seen him, you love him; and even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy, <sup>9</sup> for you are receiving the goal of your faith, the salvation of your souls. <p>&nbsp;<sup>10</sup> Concerning this salvation, the prophets, who spoke of the grace that was to come to you, searched intently and with the greatest care, <sup>11</sup> trying to find out the time and circumstances to which the Spirit of Christ in them was pointing when he predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories that would follow. <sup>12</sup> It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves but you, when they spoke of the things that have now been told you by those who have preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. Even angels long to look into these things. &nbsp;<sup>13</sup> Therefore, prepare your minds for action; be self-controlled; set your hope fully on the grace to be given you when Jesus Christ is revealed. <sup>14</sup> As obedient children, do not conform to the evil desires you had when you lived in ignorance. <sup>15</sup> But just as he who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do; <sup>16</sup> for it is written: "Be holy, because I am holy.".<sup></sup> <p>&nbsp;<sup>17</sup> Since you call on a Father who judges each man's work impartially, live your lives as strangers here in reverent fear. <sup>18</sup> For you know that it was not with perishable things such as silver or gold that you were redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to you from your forefathers, <sup>19</sup> but with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or defect. <sup>20</sup> He was chosen before the creation of the world, but was revealed in these last times for your sake. <sup>21</sup> Through him you believe in God, who raised him from the dead and glorified him, and so your faith and hope are in God. <p>&nbsp;<sup>22</sup> Now that you have purified yourselves by obeying the truth so that you have sincere love for your brothers, love one another deeply, from the heart.<sup></sup> <sup>23</sup> For you have been born again, not of perishable seed, but of imperishable, through the living and enduring word of God. <sup>24</sup> For, <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All men are like grass, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all their glory is like the flowers of the field; <br />the grass withers and the flowers fall, <br />&nbsp;<sup>25</sup> but the word of the Lord stands forever.".<sup></sup> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this is the word that was preached to you. <h4>1 Peter 2</h4><p>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> Therefore, rid yourselves of all malice and all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and slander of every kind. <sup>2</sup> Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation, <sup>3</sup> now that you have tasted that the Lord is good. </p> <br><h3>Psalm 131:1-3</h3> <p><h4>Psalm 131</h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> My heart is not proud, O LORD, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my eyes are not haughty; <br />I do not concern myself with great matters <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or things too wonderful for me. <br /><sup>2</sup> But I have stilled and quieted my soul; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a weaned child with its mother, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a weaned child is my soul within me. <p>&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> O Israel, put your hope in the LORD <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;both now and forevermore. </p><br>
