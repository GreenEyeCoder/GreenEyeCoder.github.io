<h3>Lamentations 3:40-5:22</h3> <p><p>&nbsp;<sup>40</sup> Let us examine our ways and test them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and let us return to the LORD. <br /><sup>41</sup> Let us lift up our hearts and our hands <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to God in heaven, and say: <br /><sup>42</sup> "We have sinned and rebelled <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you have not forgiven. <p>&nbsp;<sup>43</sup> "You have covered yourself with anger and pursued us; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you have slain without pity. <br /><sup>44</sup> You have covered yourself with a cloud <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that no prayer can get through. <br /><sup>45</sup> You have made us scum and refuse <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;among the nations. <p>&nbsp;<sup>46</sup> "All our enemies have opened their mouths <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wide against us. <br /><sup>47</sup> We have suffered terror and pitfalls, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ruin and destruction." <br /><sup>48</sup> Streams of tears flow from my eyes <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because my people are destroyed. <p>&nbsp;<sup>49</sup> My eyes will flow unceasingly, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without relief, <br /><sup>50</sup> until the LORD looks down <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from heaven and sees. <br /><sup>51</sup> What I see brings grief to my soul <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of all the women of my city. <p>&nbsp;<sup>52</sup> Those who were my enemies without cause <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hunted me like a bird. <br /><sup>53</sup> They tried to end my life in a pit <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and threw stones at me; <br /><sup>54</sup> the waters closed over my head, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I thought I was about to be cut off. <p>&nbsp;<sup>55</sup> I called on your name, O LORD, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the depths of the pit. <br /><sup>56</sup> You heard my plea: "Do not close your ears <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to my cry for relief." <br /><sup>57</sup> You came near when I called you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you said, "Do not fear." <p>&nbsp;<sup>58</sup> O Lord, you took up my case; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you redeemed my life. <br /><sup>59</sup> You have seen, O LORD, the wrong done to me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uphold my cause! <br /><sup>60</sup> You have seen the depth of their vengeance, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all their plots against me. <p>&nbsp;<sup>61</sup> O LORD, you have heard their insults, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all their plots against meâ€” <br /><sup>62</sup> what my enemies whisper and mutter <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against me all day long. <br /><sup>63</sup> Look at them! Sitting or standing, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they mock me in their songs. <p>&nbsp;<sup>64</sup> Pay them back what they deserve, O LORD, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for what their hands have done. <br /><sup>65</sup> Put a veil over their hearts, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and may your curse be on them! <br /><sup>66</sup> Pursue them in anger and destroy them <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from under the heavens of the LORD. <h4>Lamentations 4</h4><p>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> <sup></sup>How the gold has lost its luster, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fine gold become dull! <br />The sacred gems are scattered <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the head of every street. <p>&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> How the precious sons of Zion, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;once worth their weight in gold, <br />are now considered as pots of clay, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the work of a potter's hands! <p>&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> Even jackals offer their breasts <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to nurse their young, <br />but my people have become heartless <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like ostriches in the desert. <p>&nbsp;<sup>4</sup> Because of thirst the infant's tongue <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sticks to the roof of its mouth; <br />the children beg for bread, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but no one gives it to them. <p>&nbsp;<sup>5</sup> Those who once ate delicacies <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are destitute in the streets. <br />Those nurtured in purple <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now lie on ash heaps. <p>&nbsp;<sup>6</sup> The punishment of my people <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is greater than that of Sodom, <br />which was overthrown in a moment <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without a hand turned to help her. <p>&nbsp;<sup>7</sup> Their princes were brighter than snow <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and whiter than milk, <br />their bodies more ruddy than rubies, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their appearance like sapphires.<sup></sup> <p>&nbsp;<sup>8</sup> But now they are blacker than soot; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are not recognized in the streets. <br />Their skin has shriveled on their bones; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it has become as dry as a stick. <p>&nbsp;<sup>9</sup> Those killed by the sword are better off <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than those who die of famine; <br />racked with hunger, they waste away <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for lack of food from the field. <p>&nbsp;<sup>10</sup> With their own hands compassionate women <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have cooked their own children, <br />who became their food <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when my people were destroyed. <p>&nbsp;<sup>11</sup> The LORD has given full vent to his wrath; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he has poured out his fierce anger. <br />He kindled a fire in Zion <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that consumed her foundations. <p>&nbsp;<sup>12</sup> The kings of the earth did not believe, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor did any of the world's people, <br />that enemies and foes could enter <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the gates of Jerusalem. <p>&nbsp;<sup>13</sup> But it happened because of the sins of her prophets <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the iniquities of her priests, <br />who shed within her <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the blood of the righteous. <p>&nbsp;<sup>14</sup> Now they grope through the streets <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like men who are blind. <br />They are so defiled with blood <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that no one dares to touch their garments. <p>&nbsp;<sup>15</sup> "Go away! You are unclean!" men cry to them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Away! Away! Don't touch us!" <br />When they flee and wander about, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people among the nations say, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They can stay here no longer." <p>&nbsp;<sup>16</sup> The LORD himself has scattered them; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he no longer watches over them. <br />The priests are shown no honor, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the elders no favor. <p>&nbsp;<sup>17</sup> Moreover, our eyes failed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;looking in vain for help; <br />from our towers we watched <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for a nation that could not save us. <p>&nbsp;<sup>18</sup> Men stalked us at every step, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so we could not walk in our streets. <br />Our end was near, our days were numbered, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for our end had come. <p>&nbsp;<sup>19</sup> Our pursuers were swifter <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than eagles in the sky; <br />they chased us over the mountains <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and lay in wait for us in the desert. <p>&nbsp;<sup>20</sup> The LORD's anointed, our very life breath, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was caught in their traps. <br />We thought that under his shadow <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we would live among the nations. <p>&nbsp;<sup>21</sup> Rejoice and be glad, O Daughter of Edom, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you who live in the land of Uz. <br />But to you also the cup will be passed; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you will be drunk and stripped naked. <p>&nbsp;<sup>22</sup> O Daughter of Zion, your punishment will end; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will not prolong your exile. <br />But, O Daughter of Edom, he will punish your sin <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and expose your wickedness. <h4>Lamentations 5</h4><p>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> Remember, O LORD, what has happened to us; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;look, and see our disgrace. <br /><sup>2</sup> Our inheritance has been turned over to aliens, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our homes to foreigners. <br /><sup>3</sup> We have become orphans and fatherless, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our mothers like widows. <br /><sup>4</sup> We must buy the water we drink; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our wood can be had only at a price. <br /><sup>5</sup> Those who pursue us are at our heels; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we are weary and find no rest. <br /><sup>6</sup> We submitted to Egypt and Assyria <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to get enough bread. <br /><sup>7</sup> Our fathers sinned and are no more, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and we bear their punishment. <br /><sup>8</sup> Slaves rule over us, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and there is none to free us from their hands. <br /><sup>9</sup> We get our bread at the risk of our lives <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of the sword in the desert. <br /><sup>10</sup> Our skin is hot as an oven, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feverish from hunger. <br /><sup>11</sup> Women have been ravished in Zion, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and virgins in the towns of Judah. <br /><sup>12</sup> Princes have been hung up by their hands; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;elders are shown no respect. <br /><sup>13</sup> Young men toil at the millstones; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;boys stagger under loads of wood. <br /><sup>14</sup> The elders are gone from the city gate; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the young men have stopped their music. <br /><sup>15</sup> Joy is gone from our hearts; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our dancing has turned to mourning. <br /><sup>16</sup> The crown has fallen from our head. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woe to us, for we have sinned! <br /><sup>17</sup> Because of this our hearts are faint, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of these things our eyes grow dim <br /><sup>18</sup> for Mount Zion, which lies desolate, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with jackals prowling over it. <p>&nbsp;<sup>19</sup> You, O LORD, reign forever; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your throne endures from generation to generation. <br /><sup>20</sup> Why do you always forget us? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you forsake us so long? <br /><sup>21</sup> Restore us to yourself, O LORD, that we may return; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;renew our days as of old <br /><sup>22</sup> unless you have utterly rejected us <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and are angry with us beyond measure. </p> <br>

<a id= "NT"></a><h3>Hebrews 1:1-14</h3> <p><h4>Hebrews 1</h4>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> In the past God spoke to our forefathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways, <sup>2</sup> but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he made the universe. <sup>3</sup> The Son is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word. After he had provided purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven. <sup>4</sup> So he became as much superior to the angels as the name he has inherited is superior to theirs. <p>&nbsp;<sup>5</sup> For to which of the angels did God ever say, <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are my Son; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;today I have become your Father<sup></sup>"<sup></sup>? <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or again, <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will be his Father, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he will be my Son"<sup></sup>? <p>&nbsp;<sup>6</sup> And again, when God brings his firstborn into the world, he says, <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let all God's angels worship him."<sup></sup> <p>&nbsp;<sup>7</sup> In speaking of the angels he says, <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He makes his angels winds, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his servants flames of fire."<sup></sup> <p>&nbsp;<sup>8</sup> But about the Son he says, <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your throne, O God, will last for ever and ever, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and righteousness will be the scepter of your kingdom. <br /><sup>9</sup> You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by anointing you with the oil of joy."<sup></sup> <p>&nbsp;<sup>10</sup> He also says, <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the beginning, O Lord, you laid the foundations of the earth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the heavens are the work of your hands. <br /><sup>11</sup> They will perish, but you remain; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they will all wear out like a garment. <br /><sup>12</sup> You will roll them up like a robe; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a garment they will be changed. <br />But you remain the same, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your years will never end."<sup></sup> <p>&nbsp;<sup>13</sup> To which of the angels did God ever say, <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sit at my right hand <br />until I make your enemies <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a footstool for your feet"<sup></sup>? <p>&nbsp;<sup>14</sup> Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation? </p> <br><h3>Psalm 119:129-136</h3> <p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<sup>129</sup> Your statutes are wonderful; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore I obey them. <br /><sup>130</sup> The unfolding of your words gives light; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it gives understanding to the simple. <br /><sup>131</sup> I open my mouth and pant, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;longing for your commands. <br /><sup>132</sup> Turn to me and have mercy on me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as you always do to those who love your name. <br /><sup>133</sup> Direct my footsteps according to your word; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let no sin rule over me. <br /><sup>134</sup> Redeem me from the oppression of men, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I may obey your precepts. <br /><sup>135</sup> Make your face shine upon your servant <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and teach me your decrees. <br /><sup>136</sup> Streams of tears flow from my eyes, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for your law is not obeyed. </p><br></div><!--closing tags for 2ndcolumn-->
