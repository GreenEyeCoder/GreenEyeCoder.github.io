        <h3>Jeremiah 50:11-51:14</h3><p></p><p>&nbsp;<sup>11</sup> "Because you rejoice and are glad, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you who pillage my inheritance, <br>because you frolic like a heifer threshing grain <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and neigh like stallions, <br><sup>12</sup> your mother will be greatly ashamed; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she who gave you birth will be disgraced. <br>She will be the least of the nations— <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a wilderness, a dry land, a desert. <br><sup>13</sup> Because of the LORD's anger she will not be inhabited <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but will be completely desolate. <br>All who pass Babylon will be horrified and scoff <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of all her wounds. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>14</sup> "Take up your positions around Babylon, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all you who draw the bow. <br>Shoot at her! Spare no arrows, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for she has sinned against the LORD. <br><sup>15</sup> Shout against her on every side! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She surrenders, her towers fall, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her walls are torn down. <br>Since this is the vengeance of the LORD, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;take vengeance on her; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do to her as she has done to others. <br><sup>16</sup> Cut off from Babylon the sower, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the reaper with his sickle at harvest. <br>Because of the sword of the oppressor <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let everyone return to his own people, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let everyone flee to his own land. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>17</sup> "Israel is a scattered flock <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that lions have chased away. <br>The first to devour him <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was the king of Assyria; <br>the last to crush his bones <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon." </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>18</sup> Therefore this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will punish the king of Babylon and his land <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as I punished the king of Assyria. <br><sup>19</sup> But I will bring Israel back to his own pasture <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he will graze on Carmel and Bashan; <br>his appetite will be satisfied <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the hills of Ephraim and Gilead. <br><sup>20</sup> In those days, at that time," <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD, <br>"search will be made for Israel's guilt, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but there will be none, <br>and for the sins of Judah, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but none will be found, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for I will forgive the remnant I spare. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>21</sup> "Attack the land of Merathaim <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and those who live in Pekod. <br>Pursue, kill and completely destroy<sup></sup> them," <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do everything I have commanded you. <br><sup>22</sup> The noise of battle is in the land, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the noise of great destruction! <br><sup>23</sup> How broken and shattered <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the hammer of the whole earth! <br>How desolate is Babylon <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;among the nations! <br><sup>24</sup> I set a trap for you, O Babylon, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you were caught before you knew it; <br>you were found and captured <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because you opposed the LORD. <br><sup>25</sup> The LORD has opened his arsenal <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and brought out the weapons of his wrath, <br>for the Sovereign LORD Almighty has work to do <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the land of the Babylonians. <br><sup>26</sup> Come against her from afar. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Break open her granaries; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pile her up like heaps of grain. <br>Completely destroy her <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and leave her no remnant. <br><sup>27</sup> Kill all her young bulls; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let them go down to the slaughter! <br>Woe to them! For their day has come, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the time for them to be punished. <br><sup>28</sup> Listen to the fugitives and refugees from Babylon <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declaring in Zion <br>how the LORD our God has taken vengeance, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vengeance for his temple. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>29</sup> "Summon archers against Babylon, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all those who draw the bow. <br>Encamp all around her; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let no one escape. <br>Repay her for her deeds; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do to her as she has done. <br>For she has defied the LORD, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Holy One of Israel. <br><sup>30</sup> Therefore, her young men will fall in the streets; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all her soldiers will be silenced in that day," <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD. <br><sup>31</sup> "See, I am against you, O arrogant one," <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the Lord, the LORD Almighty, <br>"for your day has come, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the time for you to be punished. <br><sup>32</sup> The arrogant one will stumble and fall <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and no one will help her up; <br>I will kindle a fire in her towns <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that will consume all who are around her." </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>33</sup> This is what the LORD Almighty says: </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The people of Israel are oppressed, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the people of Judah as well. <br>All their captors hold them fast, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;refusing to let them go. <br><sup>34</sup> Yet their Redeemer is strong; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD Almighty is his name. <br>He will vigorously defend their cause <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that he may bring rest to their land, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but unrest to those who live in Babylon. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>35</sup> "A sword against the Babylonians!" <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD— <br>"against those who live in Babylon <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and against her officials and wise men! <br><sup>36</sup> A sword against her false prophets! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will become fools. <br>A sword against her warriors! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will be filled with terror. <br><sup>37</sup> A sword against her horses and chariots <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all the foreigners in her ranks! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will become women. <br>A sword against her treasures! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will be plundered. <br><sup>38</sup> A drought on<sup></sup> her waters! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will dry up. <br>For it is a land of idols, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;idols that will go mad with terror. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>39</sup> "So desert creatures and hyenas will live there, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and there the owl will dwell. <br>It will never again be inhabited <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or lived in from generation to generation. <br><sup>40</sup> As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;along with their neighboring towns," <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD, <br>"so no one will live there; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no man will dwell in it. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>41</sup> "Look! An army is coming from the north; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a great nation and many kings <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are being stirred up from the ends of the earth. <br><sup>42</sup> They are armed with bows and spears; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are cruel and without mercy. <br>They sound like the roaring sea <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as they ride on their horses; <br>they come like men in battle formation <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to attack you, O Daughter of Babylon. <br><sup>43</sup> The king of Babylon has heard reports about them, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his hands hang limp. <br>Anguish has gripped him, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pain like that of a woman in labor. <br><sup>44</sup> Like a lion coming up from Jordan's thickets <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to a rich pastureland, <br>I will chase Babylon from its land in an instant. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is the chosen one I will appoint for this? <br>Who is like me and who can challenge me? <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what shepherd can stand against me?" <br><sup>45</sup> Therefore, hear what the LORD has planned against Babylon, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what he has purposed against the land of the Babylonians: <br>The young of the flock will be dragged away; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will completely destroy their pasture because of them. <br><sup>46</sup> At the sound of Babylon's capture the earth will tremble; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its cry will resound among the nations. </p><h4>Jeremiah 51</h4><p>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> This is what the LORD says: </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"See, I will stir up the spirit of a destroyer <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against Babylon and the people of Leb Kamai.<sup></sup> <br><sup>2</sup> I will send foreigners to Babylon <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to winnow her and to devastate her land; <br>they will oppose her on every side <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the day of her disaster. <br><sup>3</sup> Let not the archer string his bow, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor let him put on his armor. <br>Do not spare her young men; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;completely destroy<sup></sup> her army. <br><sup>4</sup> They will fall down slain in Babylon,<sup></sup> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fatally wounded in her streets. <br><sup>5</sup> For Israel and Judah have not been forsaken <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by their God, the LORD Almighty, <br>though their land<sup></sup> is full of guilt <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before the Holy One of Israel. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>6</sup> "Flee from Babylon! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Run for your lives! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not be destroyed because of her sins. <br>It is time for the LORD's vengeance; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will pay her what she deserves. <br><sup>7</sup> Babylon was a gold cup in the LORD's hand; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she made the whole earth drunk. <br>The nations drank her wine; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore they have now gone mad. <br><sup>8</sup> Babylon will suddenly fall and be broken. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wail over her! <br>Get balm for her pain; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perhaps she can be healed. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>9</sup> ""˜We would have healed Babylon, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but she cannot be healed; <br>let us leave her and each go to his own land, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for her judgment reaches to the skies, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it rises as high as the clouds.' </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>10</sup> ""˜The LORD has vindicated us; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come, let us tell in Zion <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what the LORD our God has done.' </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>11</sup> "Sharpen the arrows, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;take up the shields! <br>The LORD has stirred up the kings of the Medes, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because his purpose is to destroy Babylon. <br>The LORD will take vengeance, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vengeance for his temple. <br><sup>12</sup> Lift up a banner against the walls of Babylon! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reinforce the guard, <br>station the watchmen, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prepare an ambush! <br>The LORD will carry out his purpose, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his decree against the people of Babylon. <br><sup>13</sup> You who live by many waters <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and are rich in treasures, <br>your end has come, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the time for you to be cut off. <br><sup>14</sup> The LORD Almighty has sworn by himself: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will surely fill you with men, as with a swarm of locusts, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they will shout in triumph over you. </p><br>

       <h3>2 Timothy 3:1-17</h3><div> <p></p><h4>2 Timothy 3</h4>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days. <sup>2</sup> People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, <sup>3</sup> without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good, <sup>4</sup> treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God— <sup>5</sup> having a form of godliness but denying its power. Have nothing to do with them. <p>&nbsp;<sup>6</sup> They are the kind who worm their way into homes and gain control over weak-willed women, who are loaded down with sins and are swayed by all kinds of evil desires, <sup>7</sup> always learning but never able to acknowledge the truth. <sup>8</sup> Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also these men oppose the truth—men of depraved minds, who, as far as the faith is concerned, are rejected. <sup>9</sup> But they will not get very far because, as in the case of those men, their folly will be clear to everyone. &nbsp;<sup>10</sup> You, however, know all about my teaching, my way of life, my purpose, faith, patience, love, endurance, <sup>11</sup> persecutions, sufferings—what kinds of things happened to me in Antioch, Iconium and Lystra, the persecutions I endured. Yet the Lord rescued me from all of them. <sup>12</sup> In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted, <sup>13</sup> while evil men and impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived. <sup>14</sup> But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have become convinced of, because you know those from whom you learned it, <sup>15</sup> and how from infancy you have known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. <sup>16</sup> All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, <sup>17</sup> so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. </p></div><br><h3>Psalm 119:89-96</h3><div> <p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<sup>89</sup> Your word, O LORD, is eternal; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it stands firm in the heavens. <br><sup>90</sup> Your faithfulness continues through all generations; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you established the earth, and it endures. <br><sup>91</sup> Your laws endure to this day, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for all things serve you. <br><sup>92</sup> If your law had not been my delight, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have perished in my affliction. <br><sup>93</sup> I will never forget your precepts, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for by them you have preserved my life. <br><sup>94</sup> Save me, for I am yours; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have sought out your precepts. <br><sup>95</sup> The wicked are waiting to destroy me, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but I will ponder your statutes. <br><sup>96</sup> To all perfection I see a limit; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but your commands are boundless. </p></div><br>
