<h3>Daniel 1-2:23</h3> <p><h4>Daniel 1</h4>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it. <sup>2</sup> And the Lord delivered Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, along with some of the articles from the temple of God. These he carried off to the temple of his god in Babylonia<sup></sup> and put in the treasure house of his god. <p>&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> Then the king ordered Ashpenaz, chief of his court officials, to bring in some of the Israelites from the royal family and the nobility— <sup>4</sup> young men without any physical defect, handsome, showing aptitude for every kind of learning, well informed, quick to understand, and qualified to serve in the king's palace. He was to teach them the language and literature of the Babylonians.<sup></sup> <sup>5</sup> The king assigned them a daily amount of food and wine from the king's table. They were to be trained for three years, and after that they were to enter the king's service. <p>&nbsp;<sup>6</sup> Among these were some from Judah: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah. <sup>7</sup> The chief official gave them new names: to Daniel, the name Belteshazzar; to Hananiah, Shadrach; to Mishael, Meshach; and to Azariah, Abednego. <p>&nbsp;<sup>8</sup> But Daniel resolved not to defile himself with the royal food and wine, and he asked the chief official for permission not to defile himself this way. <sup>9</sup> Now God had caused the official to show favor and sympathy to Daniel, <sup>10</sup> but the official told Daniel, "I am afraid of my lord the king, who has assigned your<sup></sup> food and drink. Why should he see you looking worse than the other young men your age? The king would then have my head because of you." <p>&nbsp;<sup>11</sup> Daniel then said to the guard whom the chief official had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, <sup>12</sup> "Please test your servants for ten days: Give us nothing but vegetables to eat and water to drink. <sup>13</sup> Then compare our appearance with that of the young men who eat the royal food, and treat your servants in accordance with what you see." <sup>14</sup> So he agreed to this and tested them for ten days. <p>&nbsp;<sup>15</sup> At the end of the ten days they looked healthier and better nourished than any of the young men who ate the royal food. <sup>16</sup> So the guard took away their choice food and the wine they were to drink and gave them vegetables instead. <p>&nbsp;<sup>17</sup> To these four young men God gave knowledge and understanding of all kinds of literature and learning. And Daniel could understand visions and dreams of all kinds. <p>&nbsp;<sup>18</sup> At the end of the time set by the king to bring them in, the chief official presented them to Nebuchadnezzar. <sup>19</sup> The king talked with them, and he found none equal to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah; so they entered the king's service. <sup>20</sup> In every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king questioned them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters in his whole kingdom. <p>&nbsp;<sup>21</sup> And Daniel remained there until the first year of King Cyrus. <h4>Daniel 2</h4>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> In the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; his mind was troubled and he could not sleep. <sup>2</sup> So the king summoned the magicians, enchanters, sorcerers and astrologers<sup></sup> to tell him what he had dreamed. When they came in and stood before the king, <sup>3</sup> he said to them, "I have had a dream that troubles me and I want to know what it means.<sup></sup>" <p>&nbsp;<sup>4</sup> Then the astrologers answered the king in Aramaic,<sup></sup> "O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will interpret it." <p>&nbsp;<sup>5</sup> The king replied to the astrologers, "This is what I have firmly decided: If you do not tell me what my dream was and interpret it, I will have you cut into pieces and your houses turned into piles of rubble. <sup>6</sup> But if you tell me the dream and explain it, you will receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor. So tell me the dream and interpret it for me." <p>&nbsp;<sup>7</sup> Once more they replied, "Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will interpret it." <p>&nbsp;<sup>8</sup> Then the king answered, "I am certain that you are trying to gain time, because you realize that this is what I have firmly decided: <sup>9</sup> If you do not tell me the dream, there is just one penalty for you. You have conspired to tell me misleading and wicked things, hoping the situation will change. So then, tell me the dream, and I will know that you can interpret it for me." <p>&nbsp;<sup>10</sup> The astrologers answered the king, "There is not a man on earth who can do what the king asks! No king, however great and mighty, has ever asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or astrologer. <sup>11</sup> What the king asks is too difficult. No one can reveal it to the king except the gods, and they do not live among men." <p>&nbsp;<sup>12</sup> This made the king so angry and furious that he ordered the execution of all the wise men of Babylon. <sup>13</sup> So the decree was issued to put the wise men to death, and men were sent to look for Daniel and his friends to put them to death. <p>&nbsp;<sup>14</sup> When Arioch, the commander of the king's guard, had gone out to put to death the wise men of Babylon, Daniel spoke to him with wisdom and tact. <sup>15</sup> He asked the king's officer, "Why did the king issue such a harsh decree?" Arioch then explained the matter to Daniel. <sup>16</sup> At this, Daniel went in to the king and asked for time, so that he might interpret the dream for him. <p>&nbsp;<sup>17</sup> Then Daniel returned to his house and explained the matter to his friends Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah. <sup>18</sup> He urged them to plead for mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that he and his friends might not be executed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. <sup>19</sup> During the night the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision. Then Daniel praised the God of heaven <sup>20</sup> and said: <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Praise be to the name of God for ever and ever; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wisdom and power are his. <br /><sup>21</sup> He changes times and seasons; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he sets up kings and deposes them. <br />He gives wisdom to the wise <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and knowledge to the discerning. <br /><sup>22</sup> He reveals deep and hidden things; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he knows what lies in darkness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and light dwells with him. <br /><sup>23</sup> I thank and praise you, O God of my fathers: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have given me wisdom and power, <br />you have made known to me what we asked of you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you have made known to us the dream of the king." </p> <br>

<a id= "NT"></a><h3>1 Peter 5:1-14</h3> <p><h4>1 Peter 5</h4>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> To the elders among you, I appeal as a fellow elder, a witness of Christ's sufferings and one who also will share in the glory to be revealed: <sup>2</sup> Be shepherds of God's flock that is under your care, serving as overseers—not because you must, but because you are willing, as God wants you to be; not greedy for money, but eager to serve; <sup>3</sup> not lording it over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock. <sup>4</sup> And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that will never fade away. <p>&nbsp;<sup>5</sup> Young men, in the same way be submissive to those who are older. All of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because, <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God opposes the proud <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but gives grace to the humble."<sup></sup> <p>&nbsp;<sup>6</sup> Humble yourselves, therefore, under God's mighty hand, that he may lift you up in due time. <sup>7</sup> Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you. <p>&nbsp;<sup>8</sup> Be self-controlled and alert. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour. <sup>9</sup> Resist him, standing firm in the faith, because you know that your brothers throughout the world are undergoing the same kind of sufferings. <p>&nbsp;<sup>10</sup> And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will himself restore you and make you strong, firm and steadfast. <sup>11</sup> To him be the power for ever and ever. Amen. &nbsp;<sup>12</sup> With the help of Silas,<sup></sup> whom I regard as a faithful brother, I have written to you briefly, encouraging you and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand fast in it. <p>&nbsp;<sup>13</sup> She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you her greetings, and so does my son Mark. <sup>14</sup> Greet one another with a kiss of love. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peace to all of you who are in Christ. </p> <br><h3>Psalm 134:1-3</h3> <p><h4>Psalm 134</h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> Praise the LORD, all you servants of the LORD <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who minister by night in the house of the LORD. <br /><sup>2</sup> Lift up your hands in the sanctuary <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and praise the LORD. <p>&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> May the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bless you from Zion. </p><br></div><!--closing tags for 2ndcolumn-->
