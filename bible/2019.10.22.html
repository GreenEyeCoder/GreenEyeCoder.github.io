        <h3>Jeremiah 48-49:6</h3> <p></p><h4>Jeremiah 48</h4>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> Concerning Moab: <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Woe to Nebo, for it will be ruined. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kiriathaim will be disgraced and captured; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the stronghold<sup></sup> will be disgraced and shattered. <br><sup>2</sup> Moab will be praised no more; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in Heshbon<sup></sup> men will plot her downfall: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"˜Come, let us put an end to that nation.' <br>You too, O Madmen,<sup></sup> will be silenced; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sword will pursue you. <br><sup>3</sup> Listen to the cries from Horonaim, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cries of great havoc and destruction. <br><sup>4</sup> Moab will be broken; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her little ones will cry out.<sup></sup> <br><sup>5</sup> They go up the way to Luhith, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weeping bitterly as they go; <br>on the road down to Horonaim <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anguished cries over the destruction are heard. <br><sup>6</sup> Flee! Run for your lives; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;become like a bush<sup></sup> in the desert. <br><sup>7</sup> Since you trust in your deeds and riches, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you too will be taken captive, <br>and Chemosh will go into exile, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;together with his priests and officials. <br><sup>8</sup> The destroyer will come against every town, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and not a town will escape. <br>The valley will be ruined <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the plateau destroyed, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because the LORD has spoken. <br><sup>9</sup> Put salt on Moab, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for she will be laid waste<sup></sup>; <br>her towns will become desolate, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with no one to live in them. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>10</sup> "A curse on him who is lax in doing the LORD's work! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A curse on him who keeps his sword from bloodshed! </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>11</sup> "Moab has been at rest from youth, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like wine left on its dregs, <br>not poured from one jar to another— <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she has not gone into exile. <br>So she tastes as she did, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and her aroma is unchanged. <br><sup>12</sup> But days are coming," <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD, <br>"when I will send men who pour from jars, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they will pour her out; <br>they will empty her jars <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and smash her jugs. <br><sup>13</sup> Then Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as the house of Israel was ashamed <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when they trusted in Bethel. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>14</sup> "How can you say, "˜We are warriors, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;men valiant in battle'? <br><sup>15</sup> Moab will be destroyed and her towns invaded; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her finest young men will go down in the slaughter," <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the King, whose name is the LORD Almighty. <br><sup>16</sup> "The fall of Moab is at hand; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her calamity will come quickly. <br><sup>17</sup> Mourn for her, all who live around her, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all who know her fame; <br>say, "˜How broken is the mighty scepter, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how broken the glorious staff!' </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>18</sup> "Come down from your glory <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and sit on the parched ground, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O inhabitants of the Daughter of Dibon, <br>for he who destroys Moab <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will come up against you <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and ruin your fortified cities. <br><sup>19</sup> Stand by the road and watch, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you who live in Aroer. <br>Ask the man fleeing and the woman escaping, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ask them, "˜What has happened?' <br><sup>20</sup> Moab is disgraced, for she is shattered. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wail and cry out! <br>Announce by the Arnon <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that Moab is destroyed. <br><sup>21</sup> Judgment has come to the plateau— <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to Holon, Jahzah and Mephaath, <br>&nbsp;<sup>22</sup> to Dibon, Nebo and Beth Diblathaim, <br>&nbsp;<sup>23</sup> to Kiriathaim, Beth Gamul and Beth Meon, <br>&nbsp;<sup>24</sup> to Kerioth and Bozrah— <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to all the towns of Moab, far and near. <br><sup>25</sup> Moab's horn<sup></sup> is cut off; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her arm is broken," <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>26</sup> "Make her drunk, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for she has defied the LORD. <br>Let Moab wallow in her vomit; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let her be an object of ridicule. <br><sup>27</sup> Was not Israel the object of your ridicule? <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was she caught among thieves, <br>that you shake your head in scorn <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whenever you speak of her? <br><sup>28</sup> Abandon your towns and dwell among the rocks, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you who live in Moab. <br>Be like a dove that makes its nest <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the mouth of a cave. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>29</sup> "We have heard of Moab's pride— <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her overweening pride and conceit, <br>her pride and arrogance <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the haughtiness of her heart. <br><sup>30</sup> I know her insolence but it is futile," <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"and her boasts accomplish nothing. <br><sup>31</sup> Therefore I wail over Moab, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for all Moab I cry out, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I moan for the men of Kir Hareseth. <br><sup>32</sup> I weep for you, as Jazer weeps, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O vines of Sibmah. <br>Your branches spread as far as the sea; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they reached as far as the sea of Jazer. <br>The destroyer has fallen <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on your ripened fruit and grapes. <br><sup>33</sup> Joy and gladness are gone <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the orchards and fields of Moab. <br>I have stopped the flow of wine from the presses; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no one treads them with shouts of joy. <br>Although there are shouts, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are not shouts of joy. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>34</sup> "The sound of their cry rises <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from Heshbon to Elealeh and Jahaz, <br>from Zoar as far as Horonaim and Eglath Shelishiyah, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for even the waters of Nimrim are dried up. <br><sup>35</sup> In Moab I will put an end <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to those who make offerings on the high places <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and burn incense to their gods," <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD. <br><sup>36</sup> "So my heart laments for Moab like a flute; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it laments like a flute for the men of Kir Hareseth. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wealth they acquired is gone. <br><sup>37</sup> Every head is shaved <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and every beard cut off; <br>every hand is slashed <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and every waist is covered with sackcloth. <br><sup>38</sup> On all the roofs in Moab <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and in the public squares <br>there is nothing but mourning, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for I have broken Moab <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a jar that no one wants," <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD. <br><sup>39</sup> "How shattered she is! How they wail! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How Moab turns her back in shame! <br>Moab has become an object of ridicule, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an object of horror to all those around her." </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>40</sup> This is what the LORD says: </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look! An eagle is swooping down, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spreading its wings over Moab. <br><sup>41</sup> Kerioth<sup></sup> will be captured <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the strongholds taken. <br>In that day the hearts of Moab's warriors <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will be like the heart of a woman in labor. <br><sup>42</sup> Moab will be destroyed as a nation <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because she defied the LORD. <br><sup>43</sup> Terror and pit and snare await you, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O people of Moab," <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD. <br><sup>44</sup> "Whoever flees from the terror <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will fall into a pit, <br>whoever climbs out of the pit <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will be caught in a snare; <br>for I will bring upon Moab <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the year of her punishment," <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>45</sup> "In the shadow of Heshbon <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fugitives stand helpless, <br>for a fire has gone out from Heshbon, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a blaze from the midst of Sihon; <br>it burns the foreheads of Moab, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the skulls of the noisy boasters. <br><sup>46</sup> Woe to you, O Moab! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Chemosh are destroyed; <br>your sons are taken into exile <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your daughters into captivity. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>47</sup> "Yet I will restore the fortunes of Moab <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in days to come," <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here ends the judgment on Moab. </p><h4>Jeremiah 49</h4>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> Concerning the Ammonites: <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what the LORD says: </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Has Israel no sons? <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has she no heirs? <br>Why then has Molech<sup></sup> taken possession of Gad? <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do his people live in its towns? <br><sup>2</sup> But the days are coming," <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD, <br>"when I will sound the battle cry <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against Rabbah of the Ammonites; <br>it will become a mound of ruins, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and its surrounding villages will be set on fire. <br>Then Israel will drive out <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those who drove her out," <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;says the LORD. <br><sup>3</sup> "Wail, O Heshbon, for Ai is destroyed! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cry out, O inhabitants of Rabbah! <br>Put on sackcloth and mourn; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rush here and there inside the walls, <br>for Molech will go into exile, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;together with his priests and officials. <br><sup>4</sup> Why do you boast of your valleys, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;boast of your valleys so fruitful? <br>O unfaithful daughter, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you trust in your riches and say, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"˜Who will attack me?' <br><sup>5</sup> I will bring terror on you <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from all those around you," <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the Lord, the LORD Almighty. <br>"Every one of you will be driven away, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and no one will gather the fugitives. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>6</sup> "Yet afterward, I will restore the fortunes of the Ammonites," <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD. </p><br>

       <h3>2 Timothy 1:1-18</h3><div> <p></p><h4>2 Timothy 1</h4><p>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according to the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus, </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> To Timothy, my dear son: </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. &nbsp;<sup>3</sup> I thank God, whom I serve, as my forefathers did, with a clear conscience, as night and day I constantly remember you in my prayers. <sup>4</sup> Recalling your tears, I long to see you, so that I may be filled with joy. <sup>5</sup> I have been reminded of your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, now lives in you also. <sup>6</sup> For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands. <sup>7</sup> For God did not give us a spirit of timidity, but a spirit of power, of love and of self-discipline. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>8</sup> So do not be ashamed to testify about our Lord, or ashamed of me his prisoner. But join with me in suffering for the gospel, by the power of God, <sup>9</sup> who has saved us and called us to a holy life—not because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace. This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time, <sup>10</sup> but it has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who has destroyed death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel. <sup>11</sup> And of this gospel I was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher. <sup>12</sup> That is why I am suffering as I am. Yet I am not ashamed, because I know whom I have believed, and am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him for that day. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>13</sup> What you heard from me, keep as the pattern of sound teaching, with faith and love in Christ Jesus. <sup>14</sup> Guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you—guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>15</sup> You know that everyone in the province of Asia has deserted me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>16</sup> May the Lord show mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains. <sup>17</sup> On the contrary, when he was in Rome, he searched hard for me until he found me. <sup>18</sup> May the Lord grant that he will find mercy from the Lord on that day! You know very well in how many ways he helped me in Ephesus. </p></div><br><h3>Psalm 119:81-88</h3><div> <p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<sup>81</sup> My soul faints with longing for your salvation, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but I have put my hope in your word. <br><sup>82</sup> My eyes fail, looking for your promise; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say, "When will you comfort me?" <br><sup>83</sup> Though I am like a wineskin in the smoke, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not forget your decrees. <br><sup>84</sup> How long must your servant wait? <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When will you punish my persecutors? <br><sup>85</sup> The arrogant dig pitfalls for me, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contrary to your law. <br><sup>86</sup> All your commands are trustworthy; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;help me, for men persecute me without cause. <br><sup>87</sup> They almost wiped me from the earth, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but I have not forsaken your precepts. <br><sup>88</sup> Preserve my life according to your love, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I will obey the statutes of your mouth. </p></div><br>
