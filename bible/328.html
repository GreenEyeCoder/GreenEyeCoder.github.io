<h3>Ezekiel 45-46:24</h3> <p></p><h4>Ezekiel 45</h4>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> ""˜When you allot the land as an inheritance, you are to present to the LORD a portion of the land as a sacred district, 25,000 cubits long and 20,000<sup></sup> cubits wide; the entire area will be holy. <sup>2</sup> Of this, a section 500 cubits square is to be for the sanctuary, with 50 cubits around it for open land. <sup>3</sup> In the sacred district, measure off a section 25,000 cubits<sup></sup> long and 10,000 cubits<sup></sup> wide. In it will be the sanctuary, the Most Holy Place. <sup>4</sup> It will be the sacred portion of the land for the priests, who minister in the sanctuary and who draw near to minister before the LORD. It will be a place for their houses as well as a holy place for the sanctuary. <sup>5</sup> An area 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 cubits wide will belong to the Levites, who serve in the temple, as their possession for towns to live in.<sup></sup> <p>&nbsp;<sup>6</sup> ""˜You are to give the city as its property an area 5,000 cubits wide and 25,000 cubits long, adjoining the sacred portion; it will belong to the whole house of Israel. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>7</sup> ""˜The prince will have the land bordering each side of the area formed by the sacred district and the property of the city. It will extend westward from the west side and eastward from the east side, running lengthwise from the western to the eastern border parallel to one of the tribal portions. <sup>8</sup> This land will be his possession in Israel. And my princes will no longer oppress my people but will allow the house of Israel to possess the land according to their tribes. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>9</sup> ""˜This is what the Sovereign LORD says: You have gone far enough, O princes of Israel! Give up your violence and oppression and do what is just and right. Stop dispossessing my people, declares the Sovereign LORD. <sup>10</sup> You are to use accurate scales, an accurate ephah<sup></sup> and an accurate bath.<sup></sup> <sup>11</sup> The ephah and the bath are to be the same size, the bath containing a tenth of a homer<sup></sup> and the ephah a tenth of a homer; the homer is to be the standard measure for both. <sup>12</sup> The shekel<sup></sup> is to consist of twenty gerahs. Twenty shekels plus twenty-five shekels plus fifteen shekels equal one mina.<sup></sup> &nbsp;<sup>13</sup> ""˜This is the special gift you are to offer: a sixth of an ephah from each homer of wheat and a sixth of an ephah from each homer of barley. <sup>14</sup> The prescribed portion of oil, measured by the bath, is a tenth of a bath from each cor (which consists of ten baths or one homer, for ten baths are equivalent to a homer). <sup>15</sup> Also one sheep is to be taken from every flock of two hundred from the well-watered pastures of Israel. These will be used for the grain offerings, burnt offerings and fellowship offerings<sup></sup> to make atonement for the people, declares the Sovereign LORD. <sup>16</sup> All the people of the land will participate in this special gift for the use of the prince in Israel. <sup>17</sup> It will be the duty of the prince to provide the burnt offerings, grain offerings and drink offerings at the festivals, the New Moons and the Sabbaths—at all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel. He will provide the sin offerings, grain offerings, burnt offerings and fellowship offerings to make atonement for the house of Israel. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>18</sup> ""˜This is what the Sovereign LORD says: In the first month on the first day you are to take a young bull without defect and purify the sanctuary. <sup>19</sup> The priest is to take some of the blood of the sin offering and put it on the doorposts of the temple, on the four corners of the upper ledge of the altar and on the gateposts of the inner court. <sup>20</sup> You are to do the same on the seventh day of the month for anyone who sins unintentionally or through ignorance; so you are to make atonement for the temple. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>21</sup> ""˜In the first month on the fourteenth day you are to observe the Passover, a feast lasting seven days, during which you shall eat bread made without yeast. <sup>22</sup> On that day the prince is to provide a bull as a sin offering for himself and for all the people of the land. <sup>23</sup> Every day during the seven days of the Feast he is to provide seven bulls and seven rams without defect as a burnt offering to the LORD, and a male goat for a sin offering. <sup>24</sup> He is to provide as a grain offering an ephah for each bull and an ephah for each ram, along with a hin<sup></sup> of oil for each ephah. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>25</sup> ""˜During the seven days of the Feast, which begins in the seventh month on the fifteenth day, he is to make the same provision for sin offerings, burnt offerings, grain offerings and oil. </p><h4>Ezekiel 46</h4><p>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> ""˜This is what the Sovereign LORD says: The gate of the inner court facing east is to be shut on the six working days, but on the Sabbath day and on the day of the New Moon it is to be opened. <sup>2</sup> The prince is to enter from the outside through the portico of the gateway and stand by the gatepost. The priests are to sacrifice his burnt offering and his fellowship offerings.<sup></sup> He is to worship at the threshold of the gateway and then go out, but the gate will not be shut until evening. <sup>3</sup> On the Sabbaths and New Moons the people of the land are to worship in the presence of the LORD at the entrance to that gateway. <sup>4</sup> The burnt offering the prince brings to the LORD on the Sabbath day is to be six male lambs and a ram, all without defect. <sup>5</sup> The grain offering given with the ram is to be an ephah,<sup></sup> and the grain offering with the lambs is to be as much as he pleases, along with a hin<sup></sup> of oil for each ephah. <sup>6</sup> On the day of the New Moon he is to offer a young bull, six lambs and a ram, all without defect. <sup>7</sup> He is to provide as a grain offering one ephah with the bull, one ephah with the ram, and with the lambs as much as he wants to give, along with a hin of oil with each ephah. <sup>8</sup> When the prince enters, he is to go in through the portico of the gateway, and he is to come out the same way. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>9</sup> ""˜When the people of the land come before the LORD at the appointed feasts, whoever enters by the north gate to worship is to go out the south gate; and whoever enters by the south gate is to go out the north gate. No one is to return through the gate by which he entered, but each is to go out the opposite gate. <sup>10</sup> The prince is to be among them, going in when they go in and going out when they go out. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>11</sup> ""˜At the festivals and the appointed feasts, the grain offering is to be an ephah with a bull, an ephah with a ram, and with the lambs as much as one pleases, along with a hin of oil for each ephah. <sup>12</sup> When the prince provides a freewill offering to the LORD—whether a burnt offering or fellowship offerings—the gate facing east is to be opened for him. He shall offer his burnt offering or his fellowship offerings as he does on the Sabbath day. Then he shall go out, and after he has gone out, the gate will be shut. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>13</sup> ""˜Every day you are to provide a year-old lamb without defect for a burnt offering to the LORD; morning by morning you shall provide it. <sup>14</sup> You are also to provide with it morning by morning a grain offering, consisting of a sixth of an ephah with a third of a hin of oil to moisten the flour. The presenting of this grain offering to the LORD is a lasting ordinance. <sup>15</sup> So the lamb and the grain offering and the oil shall be provided morning by morning for a regular burnt offering. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>16</sup> ""˜This is what the Sovereign LORD says: If the prince makes a gift from his inheritance to one of his sons, it will also belong to his descendants; it is to be their property by inheritance. <sup>17</sup> If, however, he makes a gift from his inheritance to one of his servants, the servant may keep it until the year of freedom; then it will revert to the prince. His inheritance belongs to his sons only; it is theirs. <sup>18</sup> The prince must not take any of the inheritance of the people, driving them off their property. He is to give his sons their inheritance out of his own property, so that none of my people will be separated from his property.'" </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>19</sup> Then the man brought me through the entrance at the side of the gate to the sacred rooms facing north, which belonged to the priests, and showed me a place at the western end. <sup>20</sup> He said to me, "This is the place where the priests will cook the guilt offering and the sin offering and bake the grain offering, to avoid bringing them into the outer court and consecrating the people." </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>21</sup> He then brought me to the outer court and led me around to its four corners, and I saw in each corner another court. <sup>22</sup> In the four corners of the outer court were enclosed<sup></sup> courts, forty cubits long and thirty cubits wide; each of the courts in the four corners was the same size. <sup>23</sup> Around the inside of each of the four courts was a ledge of stone, with places for fire built all around under the ledge. <sup>24</sup> He said to me, "These are the kitchens where those who minister at the temple will cook the sacrifices of the people." </p> <br><h3>1 Peter 3:1-22</h3> <p></p>

<a id= "NT"></a><h4>1 Peter 3</h4>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> Wives, in the same way be submissive to your husbands so that, if any of them do not believe the word, they may be won over without words by the behavior of their wives, <sup>2</sup> when they see the purity and reverence of your lives. <sup>3</sup> Your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such as braided hair and the wearing of gold jewelry and fine clothes. <sup>4</sup> Instead, it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God's sight. <sup>5</sup> For this is the way the holy women of the past who put their hope in God used to make themselves beautiful. They were submissive to their own husbands, <sup>6</sup> like Sarah, who obeyed Abraham and called him her master. You are her daughters if you do what is right and do not give way to fear. <p>&nbsp;<sup>7</sup> Husbands, in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives, and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life, so that nothing will hinder your prayers. &nbsp;<sup>8</sup> Finally, all of you, live in harmony with one another; be sympathetic, love as brothers, be compassionate and humble. <sup>9</sup> Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult, but with blessing, because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing. <sup>10</sup> For, </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whoever would love life <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and see good days <br>must keep his tongue from evil <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his lips from deceitful speech. <br><sup>11</sup> He must turn from evil and do good; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he must seek peace and pursue it. <br><sup>12</sup> For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his ears are attentive to their prayer, <br>but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil."<sup></sup> </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>13</sup> Who is going to harm you if you are eager to do good? <sup>14</sup> But even if you should suffer for what is right, you are blessed. "Do not fear what they fear<sup></sup>; do not be frightened."<sup></sup> <sup>15</sup> But in your hearts set apart Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect, <sup>16</sup> keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak maliciously against your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed of their slander. <sup>17</sup> It is better, if it is God's will, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil. <sup>18</sup> For Christ died for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. He was put to death in the body but made alive by the Spirit, <sup>19</sup> through whom<sup></sup> also he went and preached to the spirits in prison <sup>20</sup> who disobeyed long ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built. In it only a few people, eight in all, were saved through water, <sup>21</sup> and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also—not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge<sup></sup> of a good conscience toward God. It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, <sup>22</sup> who has gone into heaven and is at God's right hand—with angels, authorities and powers in submission to him. </p> <br><h3>Proverbs 28:18-28</h3> <p></p><p>&nbsp;<sup>18</sup> He whose walk is blameless is kept safe, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he whose ways are perverse will suddenly fall. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>19</sup> He who works his land will have abundant food, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the one who chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>20</sup> A faithful man will be richly blessed, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but one eager to get rich will not go unpunished. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>21</sup> To show partiality is not good— <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet a man will do wrong for a piece of bread. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>22</sup> A stingy man is eager to get rich <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and is unaware that poverty awaits him. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>23</sup> He who rebukes a man will in the end gain more favor <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than he who has a flattering tongue. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>24</sup> He who robs his father or mother <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and says, "It's not wrong"— <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he is partner to him who destroys. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>25</sup> A greedy man stirs up dissension, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who trusts in the LORD will prosper. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>26</sup> He who trusts in himself is a fool, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who walks in wisdom is kept safe. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>27</sup> He who gives to the poor will lack nothing, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who closes his eyes to them receives many curses. </p><p>&nbsp;<sup>28</sup> When the wicked rise to power, people go into hiding; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but when the wicked perish, the righteous thrive. </p><br></div><!--closing tags for 2ndcolumn-->
