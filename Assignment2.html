    <h2>Assignment Abstract / Learning Objectives</h2>
    <p>In this assignment, you will apply the following skills:</p>
    <ul>
    <li class="ListItem">continue to work with semantic tags, and document structure</li>
    <li class="ListItem">develop nested lists,</li>
    <li class="ListItem">work with simple and jagged tables,</li>
    <li class="ListItem">apply simple table formatting with CSS and use named entities.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <p>For each page, you must include an image containing the results of the validation report. This image should appear at the bottom of each page.</p>
    <h3>Index.html</h3>
    <p>The first page does very little. On this page, create links to the other pages of the assignment. At the top of the remaining pages, create links to the other pages of the assignment. Again, draw a horizontal line above and below the links. Enclose the links inside of a semantic navigation section. <strong>Also, create the links in a table such that each link appears in a table cell. The links should all appear in the same row. Basically, you are creating a menu. The menu's appearance should be the same on all of the pages. Wrap the menu in a navigation tag.</strong></p>
    <h3>ReferenceManual.html</h3>
    <p>At the top of the page, create the navigation section is as you did with the first page. The menus (header) on all pages should look exactly the same.</p>
    <p>The content of this page should contain a reference page for an HTML element. In this case, your reference page should describe the<span>&nbsp;</span><code>&lt;a&gt;</code><span>&nbsp;</span>tag and its attributes and provide examples of their use. The assessment for this page is based not only the HTML, but the accuracy and completeness of the content that you write. You should instruct me how to create an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag, list it's attributes, and tell me how to use them.</p>
    <p>Below the menu, create three bookmarks that will navigate to the three different sections of the page (Abstract, Details, Examples). The bookmarks should all appear on the same line. Put another horizontal rule below the bookmarks.</p>
    <ul>
    <li class="ListItem">Wrap the page content as a semantic &lt;article&gt;. Create a level 1 heading for the article. Create level 2 headings for each of the sections.</li>
    <li class="ListItem">Create sections titled<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Abstract</strong>,<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Details</strong>, and<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Examples</strong>.</li>
    <li class="ListItem">In the Abstract section, write a short paragraph or two that summarizes the purpose of the anchor tag. Mention how it is used to create links to other pages and bookmarks.</li>
    <li class="ListItem">In the Details section, create a bulleted list that describes the purpose of the attributes applicable to the anchor tag.</li>
    <li class="ListItem">In the Examples section, create two or three examples that demonstrate the use of absolute and relative references. Feel free to create additional examples as you see fit.</li>
    <li class="ListItem">Format the page such that the element and attribute names appear in a mono-space courier typeface. &lt;code&gt;. Use the semantic &lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt; tags as you see fit.</li>
    <li class="ListItem">Put any placeholder text in italics. Again, use &lt;em&gt; for italics.</li>
    <li class="ListItem">Code examples must appear in a mono-space courier font. You will need to use named entities for the less-than and greater-than symbols.</li>
    <li class="ListItem">For the Examples section, set any code using mono-space courier font. Placeholder text should appear in italics.</li>
    <li class="ListItem">Your content should be correct and informative.<br><br>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Table1.html</h3>
    <p>Create a table that looks contains the following data:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <img src="http://business.unr.edu/faculty/ekedahl/IS360/Assignment2Table2.png" alt="Table" width="940" style="max-width: 838px;">
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Your performance will be based on your ability to make the table look similar to the one shown in the figure. Remember, the table must be declared correctly and should pass the W3C validation service. You must apply subscripts and superscripts as shown in the image. Use the appropriate &lt;sub&gt; (subscript) and &lt;sup&gt; superscript tag. You must make use of the degrees symbol Â°. You should use a boldface font &lt;strong&gt;, where appropriate. Note that some of the column headers span multiple columns. Thus, you are creating a jagged table. <strong>Try to create the shaded row and the underlined cells.</strong></p>
    <p>Use table headers and footers as appropriate.</p>
    <h3>
    <br>Table2.html</h3>
    <p>In this section you will create another table that mimics the NWS web site current forecast shown in the following figure.<br><br></p>
    <img src="http://business.unr.edu/faculty/ekedahl/IS360/Weather.png" alt="Table" width="940" style="max-width: 838px;">
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Again, your performance will be based on your ability to make the table look similar to the one shown in the figure. Remember, the table must be declared correctly and should pass the W3C validation service. You are creating tables here. You might use tables inside of tables. You might create multiple jagged tables. It's all up to you.</p>
    <p>For example, I would implement the forecast as a table with 9 columns (days) and 4 rows (date, image, forecast, temp.&nbsp; Try and change the fonts and colors too. You don't need to be exact.<br><br></p>
